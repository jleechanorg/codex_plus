Post replies to all comments on the current PR (PR #2) using the tag [AI responder codex].

Execute these commands:

```bash
# Get repo info
owner=$(gh repo view --json owner --jq .owner.login)
repo=$(gh repo view --json name --jq .name)

# Get all review comments for PR #2
comments=$(gh api repos/$owner/$repo/pulls/2/comments --paginate)
comment_count=$(echo "$comments" | jq length)
echo "Found $comment_count review comments"

# Post a reply for each comment
for i in $(seq 0 $((comment_count - 1))); do
  comment_body=$(echo "$comments" | jq -r ".[$i].body" | head -c 50)
  echo "Replying to comment: $comment_body..."
  gh api repos/$owner/$repo/issues/2/comments \
    -X POST \
    -f body="[AI responder codex] Acknowledged review comment: \"$comment_body...\" - This feedback will be addressed in the implementation."
done

# Post summary
gh api repos/$owner/$repo/issues/2/comments \
  -X POST \
  -f body="[AI responder codex] All $comment_count review comments have been acknowledged and will be addressed."
```

### Phase 5: Push Changes
After all fixes are complete:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: address PR review comments"
git push origin HEAD
```

### Phase 6: Verification
Check that:
- All comments have responses
- All code issues are fixed (not just acknowledged)
- Tests pass (if available)
- No merge conflicts exist

## Expected Outputs

1. **List of all PR comments** with their IDs
2. **Actual code changes** made to address issues
3. **Posted responses** to each comment
4. **Final status** showing all issues resolved

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT** just post GitHub reviews saying "fixed" - make actual code changes
- **DO NOT** skip implementation - every fixable issue needs code changes
- **DO** use git diff to verify changes were made
- **DO** post threaded replies to maintain conversation context

## Example Commands

```bash
# Get PR details
gh pr view 2 --json title,body,state,comments

# Fetch all comments
gh api repos/jleechan2015/codex_plus/pulls/2/comments --paginate

# Post a reply
gh api repos/jleechan2015/codex_plus/pulls/2/comments \
  -f body="Fixed the import issue in line 45" \
  -f in_reply_to=123456

# Verify changes
git diff HEAD~1

# Push fixes
git add -A && git commit -m "fix: address review comments" && git push
```
