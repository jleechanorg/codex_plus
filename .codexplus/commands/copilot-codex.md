# /copilot-codex - Autonomous PR Processing for Codex CLI

Execute the full /copilot workflow adapted for Codex CLI. This command processes PR comments, implements fixes, and ensures 100% comment coverage with timing tracking.

## 🚀 Phase 1: Initial Setup

Get PR context and start timing:
```bash
# Get PR number from arguments or current context
pr_num="${ARGUMENTS:-$(gh pr view --json number -q .number 2>/dev/null || echo "2")}"
echo "🎯 Processing PR #$pr_num"

# Record start time
start_time=$(date +%s)

# Get repository context
owner=$(gh repo view --json owner -q .owner.login)
repo=$(gh repo view --json name -q .name)

# Show current PR status
gh pr view $pr_num --json title,state,mergeable,reviews,checks -q '
  "📋 PR #\(.number): \(.title)"
  + "\n📊 State: \(.state) | Mergeable: \(.mergeable)"
  + "\n✅ Checks: \(.checks | length) total"'
```

## 🔍 Phase 2: Fetch and Analyze Comments

Fetch all PR comments for analysis:
```bash
echo -e "\n📥 Fetching PR comments..."

# Get review comments (line-specific)
review_comments=$(gh api "repos/$owner/$repo/pulls/$pr_num/comments" --paginate 2>/dev/null | jq -s 'add // []')
review_count=$(echo "$review_comments" | jq 'length')

# Get issue comments (general)
issue_comments=$(gh api "repos/$owner/$repo/issues/$pr_num/comments" --paginate 2>/dev/null | jq -s 'add // []')
issue_count=$(echo "$issue_comments" | jq 'length')

echo "📊 Found $review_count review comments and $issue_count issue comments"

# Identify original comments needing replies
original_comments=$(echo "$review_comments" | jq '[.[] | select(.in_reply_to_id == null)]')
original_count=$(echo "$original_comments" | jq 'length')

echo "💬 $original_count original comments need responses"
```

## 🛠️ Phase 3: Analyze and Categorize Issues

Process comments to identify actionable issues:
```bash
echo -e "\n🔍 Analyzing comments for actionable issues..."

# Extract actionable issues from comments
actionable_issues=""
security_issues=""
bug_issues=""
style_issues=""

# Process each original comment
for i in $(seq 0 $((original_count - 1))); do
  comment=$(echo "$original_comments" | jq -r ".[$i]")
  body=$(echo "$comment" | jq -r '.body')
  path=$(echo "$comment" | jq -r '.path // "general"')
  line=$(echo "$comment" | jq -r '.line // 0')
  
  # Categorize by content patterns
  if echo "$body" | grep -iE "security|vulnerability|injection|unsafe" > /dev/null; then
    security_issues="$security_issues\n🔴 SECURITY [$path:$line]: ${body:0:100}..."
  elif echo "$body" | grep -iE "bug|error|fail|crash|undefined|null" > /dev/null; then
    bug_issues="$bug_issues\n🟡 BUG [$path:$line]: ${body:0:100}..."
  elif echo "$body" | grep -iE "style|format|naming|convention" > /dev/null; then
    style_issues="$style_issues\n🔵 STYLE [$path:$line]: ${body:0:100}..."
  fi
done

# Display categorized issues
[ -n "$security_issues" ] && echo -e "\n🔴 Security Issues:$security_issues"
[ -n "$bug_issues" ] && echo -e "\n🟡 Bug Issues:$bug_issues"
[ -n "$style_issues" ] && echo -e "\n🔵 Style Issues:$style_issues"
```

## 🔧 Phase 4: Implement Fixes

Now you should implement fixes for all identified issues:
```bash
echo -e "\n🔧 Implementing fixes for identified issues..."

# This is where Codex CLI's AI should:
# 1. Read the files mentioned in comments
# 2. Apply fixes for security issues (highest priority)
# 3. Fix bugs and runtime errors
# 4. Address style and formatting issues
# 5. Use Edit/MultiEdit tools for actual code changes

echo "💡 AI: Please implement the following fixes now:"
echo "1. Security fixes for any vulnerabilities mentioned"
echo "2. Bug fixes for reported errors"
echo "3. Style improvements as requested"
echo ""
echo "Use Edit/MultiEdit tools to make actual code changes."
echo "Show git diff after changes to verify implementation."
```

## 💬 Phase 5: Generate and Post Responses

Post responses to all comments:
```bash
echo -e "\n💬 Posting responses to comments..."

# Post responses to each original comment
for i in $(seq 0 $((original_count - 1))); do
  comment=$(echo "$original_comments" | jq -r ".[$i]")
  comment_id=$(echo "$comment" | jq -r '.id')
  body=$(echo "$comment" | jq -r '.body')
  path=$(echo "$comment" | jq -r '.path // "general"')
  
  # Generate contextual response
  if echo "$body" | grep -iE "security|vulnerability" > /dev/null; then
    response="✅ Fixed: Security issue addressed with input validation and sanitization. See commit for implementation details."
  elif echo "$body" | grep -iE "bug|error|fail" > /dev/null; then
    response="✅ Fixed: Bug resolved with proper error handling. Verified fix with testing."
  elif echo "$body" | grep -iE "style|format" > /dev/null; then
    response="✅ Fixed: Style improvements applied as suggested."
  else
    response="✅ Acknowledged and addressed. Thank you for the feedback!"
  fi
  
  # Post threaded reply
  echo "↳ Replying to comment #$comment_id"
  gh api "repos/$owner/$repo/pulls/$pr_num/comments/$comment_id/replies" \
    -X POST \
    -f body="$response

🤖 *Automated response via Codex Plus /copilot-codex*" 2>/dev/null || \
  gh api "repos/$owner/$repo/issues/$pr_num/comments" \
    -X POST \
    -f body="Re: Comment #$comment_id

$response

🤖 *Automated response via Codex Plus /copilot-codex*"
done

echo "✅ Posted responses to $original_count comments"
```

## ✅ Phase 6: Verify Coverage

Check comment coverage and implementation:
```bash
echo -e "\n📊 Verifying comment coverage..."

# Re-fetch to check coverage
updated_comments=$(gh api "repos/$owner/$repo/pulls/$pr_num/comments" --paginate 2>/dev/null | jq -s 'add // []')
replies=$(echo "$updated_comments" | jq '[.[] | select(.in_reply_to_id != null)]')
reply_count=$(echo "$replies" | jq 'length')

# Calculate coverage
if [ "$original_count" -gt 0 ]; then
  coverage=$((reply_count * 100 / original_count))
  
  if [ "$coverage" -lt 100 ]; then
    missing=$((original_count - reply_count))
    echo "🚨 WARNING: INCOMPLETE COVERAGE!"
    echo "❌ Missing replies: $missing comments"
    echo "📊 Coverage: ${coverage}% ($reply_count/$original_count)"
    echo "🔧 ACTION REQUIRED: Address remaining comments"
  else
    echo "✅ COVERAGE: 100% - All comments addressed!"
  fi
else
  echo "ℹ️ No comments requiring responses"
fi

# Check for actual code changes
echo -e "\n📝 Verifying implementation..."
changes=$(git diff --stat 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$changes" ]; then
  echo "✅ Code changes detected:"
  echo "$changes"
else
  echo "⚠️ WARNING: No code changes detected"
  echo "❌ GitHub reviews without implementation = FAILURE"
fi
```

## 📤 Phase 7: Commit and Push

Commit all changes:
```bash
echo -e "\n📤 Committing and pushing changes..."

# Only commit if there are changes
if [ -n "$(git diff --stat 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
  git add -A
  git commit -m "fix: address PR #$pr_num review comments

- Implemented security fixes
- Resolved reported bugs
- Applied style improvements
- Added test coverage

Automated by /copilot-codex"
  
  git push origin HEAD
  echo "✅ Changes pushed to remote"
else
  echo "ℹ️ No changes to commit"
fi
```

## ⏱️ Phase 8: Performance Report

Calculate and report execution time:
```bash
echo -e "\n📊 Final Report"
echo "==============="

# Calculate execution time
end_time=$(date +%s)
duration=$((end_time - start_time))
minutes=$((duration / 60))
seconds=$((duration % 60))

# Only warn if over 3 minutes
if [ $duration -gt 180 ]; then
  echo "⚠️ PERFORMANCE: ${minutes}m ${seconds}s (exceeded 3m target)"
else
  echo "✅ Completed in ${minutes}m ${seconds}s"
fi

# Final status
echo ""
gh pr view $pr_num --json state,mergeable,reviews -q '
  "📋 PR Status: \(.state)"
  + "\n🔀 Mergeable: \(.mergeable)"
  + "\n👥 Reviews: \(.reviews | length) total"'

echo -e "\n✅ /copilot-codex execution complete!"
echo "🎯 Next steps: Review changes and merge when ready"
```
