# Enhanced Code Review Command

**Usage**: `/review-enhanced` or `/reviewe` (alias)

**Purpose**: Perform comprehensive code analysis with multi-pass security review (simplified version of `/reviewdeep`)

## Implementation

When `/reviewe` is invoked, Claude executes directly:

1. **PR/Code Analysis**: 
   - Analyze changed files and code patterns
   - Focus on new code additions and significant modifications
   - Identify potential issues and improvement opportunities

2. **Multi-Pass Security & Quality Analysis**:
   - **Pass 1**: Security vulnerabilities, authentication flaws, input validation
   - **Pass 2**: Runtime errors, null pointers, resource leaks, edge cases  
   - **Pass 3**: Performance issues, inefficient algorithms, optimization opportunities
   - **Pass 4**: Code quality, maintainability, documentation, best practices

3. **Issue Categorization**:
   - **🔴 Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, runtime errors, data corruption risks
   - **🟡 Important**: Performance issues, maintainability problems, architectural concerns  
   - **🔵 Suggestion**: Style improvements, refactoring opportunities, optimizations
   - **🟢 Nitpick**: Minor style issues, documentation improvements, conventions

## Key Security & Testing Patterns

**🚨 Critical Security Issues**:
- `shell=True` usage → Must use list args with `shell=False, timeout=30`
- Missing input validation → Whitelist patterns instead of blind interpolation
- SQL injection risks → Parameterized queries only
- Command injection → Never construct commands from user input

**🚨 Critical Test Issues**:  
- `@unittest.skipIf` or `pytest.skip()` → Use mocks instead
- Environment-dependent tests → Must behave identically everywhere
- Missing cleanup → Use context managers and `finally` blocks
