# /copilot-lite - Streamlined PR Processing

**Purpose**: Ultra-fast PR processing that FIXES ALL ISSUES until GitHub shows ready-for-merge

üö® **CRITICAL**: This command DOES WORK - fixes conflicts, responds to comments, resolves test failures. NOT a diagnostic tool.

## üö® ALL COMMENTS FIRST - MANDATORY HUMAN PRIORITY PROTOCOL

**üö® CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: EVERY PR comment MUST receive a response - human feedback takes ABSOLUTE PRIORITY over automated suggestions.

**HUMAN COMMENT HANDLING REQUIREMENTS**:
- ‚úÖ **Check ALL authors including human reviewers** - Not just bots
- ‚úÖ **Respond to questions, not just fix issues** - Human questions require answers
- ‚úÖ **Human comments are equally important as bot comments** - Actually MORE important
- ‚úÖ **100% ALL comment response rate** - No exceptions, no priorities that skip comments

**PRIORITY ORDER - HUMAN FIRST**: Human Questions ‚Üí Human Style Feedback ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Runtime Errors ‚Üí Test Failures ‚Üí Automated Style

## Core Workflow - MANDATORY ACTION PHASES

### Phase 1: Assessment
`/execute` - Plan PR processing work

### Phase 2: Collection
`/commentfetch` - Get ALL PR comments and issues (human + automated)

### Phase 3: Resolution (MANDATORY FIXES)
`/fixpr` - **MUST FIX** ALL feedback by priority: Human Questions ‚Üí Human Style ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Runtime ‚Üí Tests ‚Üí Automated Style
- **MANDATORY**: Resolve ALL merge conflicts (not just detect them)
- **MANDATORY**: Fix ALL failing tests (not just report them)
- **MANDATORY**: Apply actual code changes (not just analysis)

### Phase 4: Response (MANDATORY COMMENT REPLIES)
`/commentreply` - **MUST POST** replies to ALL unresponded comments (human + automated)
- **MANDATORY**: Generate responses for EVERY unresponded comment (prioritize human questions)
- **MANDATORY**: Post actual GitHub comment replies (not just drafts)
- **MANDATORY**: Achieve 100% ALL comment coverage (not just measure it)

### Phase 5: Verification
`/commentcheck` - Verify 100% comment coverage with warnings if incomplete

### Phase 6: Iteration (MANDATORY UNTIL COMPLETE)
**MANDATORY**: Repeat Phases 3‚Äì5 until GitHub shows ALL criteria met, with strict bounds:
- ‚úÖ No failing tests
- ‚úÖ No merge conflicts
- ‚úÖ No unaddressed comments (human + automated)
- ‚úÖ CI passing
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Hard caps**: max 5 iterations or 30 minutes total runtime for the entire PR processing workflow (whichever comes first), with exponential backoff between attempts; on cap, stop and post a summary + next actions
- **Stop** when no-op cycles are detected (no diffs, no new replies), then surface a summary and next actions

### Phase 7: Push
`/pushl` - Push changes with labels and description

### Phase 8: Learning
`/guidelines` - Capture patterns for mistake prevention

## Success Criteria - WORK COMPLETION REQUIRED

üö® **MANDATORY WORK COMPLETION**:
- **100% ALL comment response rate** - EVERY unresponded comment (human + automated) MUST receive posted replies
- **Zero merge conflicts** - ALL conflicts MUST be resolved (not just detected)
- **All tests passing** - ALL failing tests MUST be fixed (not just reported)
- **CI green** - ALL checks MUST pass (not just analyzed)
- **GitHub mergeable** - PR MUST show ready-for-merge status

**FAILURE CONDITIONS**:
- ‚ùå Declaring "success" with unresponded comments (human or automated)
- ‚ùå Reporting conflicts without resolving them
- ‚ùå Identifying test failures without fixing them
- ‚ùå Analysis without implementation
- ‚ùå Stopping before GitHub shows mergeable

## Usage

```bash
/copilot-lite
# FIXES all PR issues until GitHub ready-for-merge
# POSTS ALL comment replies (human + automated) until 100% coverage
# RESOLVES all conflicts until clean merge
# Stops when work is complete OR caps are reached; on cap, posts a summary + next actions
```

üö® **WORK-FOCUSED OPERATION**: MUST complete actual work - resolve conflicts, post replies, fix tests. Analysis alone = FAILURE.

**Autonomous Operation**: Continues through conflicts without user approval for fixes. Merge operations still require explicit approval.
