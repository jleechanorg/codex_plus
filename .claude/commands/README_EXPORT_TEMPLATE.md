# Claude Commands - LLM Capital Efficiency Framework Implementation

‚ö†Ô∏è **PROTOTYPE WIP REPOSITORY** - This is an experimental command system exported from a working development environment. Use as reference but note it hasn't been extensively tested outside of the original workflow. Expect adaptation needed for your specific setup.

## üöÄ LLM Capital Efficiency Framework in Action

Transform Claude Code from a productivity tool into development infrastructure that generates measurable velocity improvements. This command system demonstrates the paradigm shift from AI consumption to systematic workflow automation, achieving 5-20x development velocity through proven automation patterns.

### üéØ Framework Metrics (Development Environment Results)
- **900+ PRs generated** in 30-day validation period during active development  
- **42-minute median merge time** with autonomous review pipeline (vs ~2-4 hours manual)
- **78% test coverage** maintained automatically through command workflows
- **156+ custom slash commands** creating systematic automation patterns
- **4-stage AI code review** pipeline reducing manual review cycles

> *Metrics collected during intensive development period using automated tracking. Results vary based on project complexity, team adoption, and workflow integration depth. Individual results may differ.*

### üí° Capital Allocator vs Consumer Mindset
| Consumer Approach | **Capital Allocator Approach** |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Goal: Minimize AI costs | **Goal: Maximize value arbitrage** |
| Focus: Reducing token usage | **Focus: Maximizing throughput of shippable work** |
| Action: Trim prompts, cache results | **Action: Build automated, multi-model workflows** |
| Outcome: 1.2x productivity | **Outcome: 5-20x development velocity** |

> *Development velocity improvements measured through PR throughput, review cycle time, and automation coverage during 30-day validation. Actual results vary significantly based on project complexity, team adoption, and workflow integration. The "5-20x" range represents observed improvements in specific metrics like PR merge time (42min vs 2-4hr) and review automation, not guaranteed universal outcomes.*

Transform Claude Code into an autonomous development powerhouse through simple command hooks that enable complex workflow orchestration and systematic automation deployment.

## üéØ The Magic: Simple Hooks ‚Üí Cognitive Capital Deployment

This isn't just a collection of commands - it's a **complete cognitive capital allocation system** that transforms how you develop software using the LLM Capital Efficiency Framework's three foundational pillars.

### üèóÔ∏è Three Foundational Pillars Implementation

#### 1. **Parallel Execution via Multiple Terminals** 
Our `/orch` command demonstrates this pillar by deploying multiple autonomous agents in isolated tmux sessions:
- **Frontend Agent**: UI/UX implementation in parallel
- **Backend Agent**: API development simultaneously  
- **Testing Agent**: Test automation concurrently
- **Opus-Master**: Architecture coordination across all agents

#### 2. **State Management via Git Worktrees**
Each command operates in isolated branch environments, enabling conflict-free parallel development:
- Automatic branch creation and management
- Individual PR creation per agent/task
- State isolation preventing cross-agent interference

#### 3. **Automation via Chained Commands**
Command composition creates sophisticated autonomous workflows:
- `/pr` chains: `/think` ‚Üí `/execute` ‚Üí `/push` ‚Üí `/copilot` ‚Üí `/review`
- `/copilot` orchestrates: analyze ‚Üí fix ‚Üí test ‚Üí document ‚Üí verify  
- `/execute` combines: plan ‚Üí approve ‚Üí implement ‚Üí validate

### Command Chaining Examples
```bash
# Multi-command composition in single request (like /fake command)
"/arch /thinku /devilsadvocate /diligent"  # ‚Üí comprehensive code analysis

# Sequential workflow chains
"/think about auth then /execute the solution"  # ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí implementation

# Conditional execution flows
"/test login flow and if fails /fix then /pr"  # ‚Üí test ‚Üí fix ‚Üí create PR
```

### Before: Manual Step-by-Step Development
```
1. Analyze the issue manually
2. Write code manually
3. Test manually
4. Create PR manually
5. Handle review comments manually
```

### After: Single Command Workflows (Capital Efficiency in Action)
```bash
/pr "fix authentication bug"     # ‚Üí think ‚Üí execute ‚Üí push ‚Üí copilot ‚Üí review
/copilot                        # ‚Üí analyze PR ‚Üí fix all issues autonomously
/execute "add user dashboard"   # ‚Üí plan ‚Üí auto-approve ‚Üí implement
/orch "implement notifications" # ‚Üí multi-agent parallel development
```

### üìà Capital Efficiency KPIs Applied
- **Utilization Rate**: 99% command execution reliability vs 20% with manual processes
- **Conversion Efficiency**: Autonomous workflows require minimal human intervention
- **Touch Rate**: Low manual correction needed due to systematic automation
- **Value Arbitrage Score**: Complex development workflows at fraction of human consultant cost

## üîç Command Deep Dive - The Composition Powerhouses

### `/cerebras` - Hybrid Code Generation (19.6x Faster)

**What It Does**: Revolutionary hybrid workflow using [Cerebras Inference API](https://www.cerebras.ai/inference) for 19.6x faster code generation (500ms vs 10s), with Claude as ARCHITECT and Cerebras as BUILDER.

**Why Cerebras Is Faster**: Cerebras achieves breakthrough performance through their Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-3) with 44GB of on-chip SRAM and 21 petabytes/second memory bandwidth - 7,000x more than traditional GPUs. By storing entire models on-chip, Cerebras eliminates the memory bandwidth bottleneck that limits GPU inference to hundreds of tokens/second, achieving over 2,100 tokens/second on large models.

**Hybrid Architecture**:
1. **Claude Analysis**: Requirements analysis and detailed specification creation
2. **Prompt Generation**: Claude creates precise, structured prompts with full context
3. **Cerebras Execution**: High-speed code generation at 500ms response time using Wafer Scale Engine
4. **Claude Integration**: Verification, integration, and quality assurance
5. **Decision Logging**: Automatic documentation in `docs/{branch}/cerebras_decisions.md`

**Perfect For**: Well-defined code generation, boilerplate, templates, unit tests, algorithms, documentation, repetitive patterns

**Real Example**:
```bash
/cerebras "create React component for user dashboard with TypeScript"
‚Üì
Claude: Analyzes requirements ‚Üí Creates detailed specification
Cerebras: Generates component code at 19.6x speed (500ms via WSE-3)
Claude: Integrates, validates, and documents decision
```

**Speed Comparison**:
- **Standard Claude**: ~10 seconds for complex code generation
- **Cerebras Hybrid**: ~500ms for same generation (19.6x faster)
- **Technical Advantage**: 2,100+ tokens/second vs GPU's ~hundreds of tokens/second
- **Quality**: Same high-quality output with architectural oversight

### `/execute` - Plan-Approve-Execute Composition

**What It Does**: Combines `/plan` ‚Üí `/preapprove` ‚Üí `/autoapprove` ‚Üí execute in one seamless workflow with TodoWrite tracking.

**3-Phase Workflow**:
1. **Planning Phase**: Executes `/plan` command - creates TodoWrite checklist and displays execution plan
2. **Approval Chain**: `/preapprove` validation followed by `/autoapprove` with message "User already approves - proceeding with execution"
3. **Implementation**: Systematic execution following the approved plan with progress updates

**Real Example**:
```bash
/execute "fix login button styling"
‚Üì
Phase 1 - Planning (/plan): Creates TodoWrite checklist and execution plan
Phase 2 - Approval Chain: /preapprove ‚Üí /autoapprove ‚Üí "User already approves - proceeding"
Phase 3 - Implementation: [Check styles ‚Üí Update CSS ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Commit]
```

### `/plan` - Manual Approval Development Planning

**What It Does**: Structured development planning with explicit user approval gates.

**Perfect For**: Complex architectural changes, high-risk modifications, learning new patterns.

**Workflow**:
1. **Deep Analysis**: Research existing system, constraints, requirements
2. **Multi-Approach Planning**: Present 2-3 different implementation approaches
3. **Resource Assessment**: Timeline, complexity, tool requirements, risk analysis
4. **Approval Gate**: User must explicitly approve before implementation
5. **Guided Execution**: Step-by-step implementation with checkpoints

### `/pr` - Complete Development Lifecycle

**What It Does**: Executes the complete 5-phase development lifecycle: `/think` ‚Üí `/execute` ‚Üí `/push` ‚Üí `/copilot` ‚Üí `/review`

**Mandatory 5-Phase Workflow**:
```
Phase 1: Think - Strategic analysis and approach planning
‚Üì
Phase 2: Execute - Implementation using /execute workflow
‚Üì
Phase 3: Push - Commit, push, and create PR with details
‚Üì
Phase 4: Copilot - Auto-executed PR analysis and issue fixing
‚Üì
Phase 5: Review - Comprehensive code review and validation
```

**Real Example**:
```bash
/pr "fix login timeout issue"
‚Üì
Think: Analyze login flow and timeout causes ‚Üí
Execute: Implement timeout fix systematically ‚Üí
Push: Create PR with comprehensive details ‚Üí
Copilot: Fix any automated feedback ‚Üí
Review: Complete code review and validation
```

### `/copilot` - Universal PR Composition with Execute

**What It Does**: Targets current branch PR by default, delegates to `/execute` for intelligent 6-phase autonomous workflow.

**6-Phase Autonomous System**:
1. **PR Analysis**: Status check, CI analysis, comment gathering
2. **Issue Detection**: Systematic problem identification and prioritization
3. **Automated Resolution**: Intelligent fixing with `/execute` optimization
4. **Quality Assurance**: Test coverage, lint validation, self-review
5. **Communication**: Reply to comments, update PR descriptions
6. **Validation**: Final verification and completion confirmation

**Perfect For**: Full autonomous PR management without manual intervention.

**Real Example**:
```bash
/copilot  # Auto-targets current branch PR
‚Üì
üéØ Targeting current branch PR: #123 ‚Üí
üöÄ Delegating to /execute for intelligent workflow ‚Üí
Analyze ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Document ‚Üí Reply ‚Üí Verify
```

### `/orch` - Multi-Agent Task Delegation System

**What It Does**: Delegates tasks to autonomous tmux-based agents working in parallel across different branches.

**Multi-Agent Architecture**:
- **Frontend Agent**: UI/UX implementation, browser testing, styling
- **Backend Agent**: API development, database integration, server logic
- **Testing Agent**: Test automation, validation, performance testing
- **Opus-Master**: Architecture decisions, code review, integration

**Real Example**:
```bash
/orch "add user notifications system"
‚Üì
Frontend Agent: notification UI components (parallel)
Backend Agent: notification API endpoints (parallel)
Testing Agent: notification test suite (parallel)
Opus-Master: architecture review and integration
‚Üì
All agents work independently ‚Üí Create individual PRs ‚Üí Integration verification
```

**Cost**: $0.003-$0.050 per task (highly efficient)

**Monitoring**:
```bash
/orch monitor agents    # Check agent status
/orch "What's running?" # Current task overview
tmux attach-session -t task-agent-frontend  # Direct agent access
```

## üí° The Composition Architecture - How It Actually Works

### The Hook Mechanism

Each command is a **simple .md file** that Claude Code reads as executable instructions. When you type `/pr "fix bug"`, Claude:

1. **Reads** `.claude/commands/pr.md`
2. **Parses** the structured prompt template
3. **Executes** the workflow defined in the markdown
4. **Composes** with other commands through shared protocols

### Multi-Command Chaining in Single Sentences

You can chain multiple commands in one request:

```bash
# Sequential execution
"/think about authentication then /arch the solution then /execute it"

# Conditional execution
"/test the login flow and if it fails /fix it then /pr the changes"

# Parallel analysis
"/debug the performance issue while /research best practices then /plan implementation"

# Full workflow composition
"/analyze the codebase /design a solution /execute with tests /pr with documentation then /copilot any issues"
```
