## 🎯 The Magic: Simple Hooks → Cognitive Capital Deployment

This isn't just a collection of commands - it's a **complete cognitive capital allocation system** that transforms how you develop software using the LLM Capital Efficiency Framework's three foundational pillars.

### 🏗️ Three Foundational Pillars Implementation

#### 1. **Parallel Execution via Multiple Terminals** 
Our `/orch` command demonstrates this pillar by deploying multiple autonomous agents in isolated tmux sessions:
- **Frontend Agent**: UI/UX implementation in parallel
- **Backend Agent**: API development simultaneously  
- **Testing Agent**: Test automation concurrently
- **Opus-Master**: Architecture coordination across all agents

#### 2. **State Management via Git Worktrees**
Each command operates in isolated branch environments, enabling conflict-free parallel development:
- Automatic branch creation and management
- Individual PR creation per agent/task
- State isolation preventing cross-agent interference

#### 3. **Automation via Chained Commands**
Command composition creates sophisticated autonomous workflows:
- `/pr` chains: `/think` → `/execute` → `/push` → `/copilot` → `/review`
- `/copilot` orchestrates: analyze → fix → test → document → verify  
- `/execute` combines: plan → approve → implement → validate

### Command Chaining Examples
```bash
# Multi-command composition in single request (like /fake command)
"/arch /thinku /devilsadvocate /diligent"  # → comprehensive code analysis

# Sequential workflow chains
"/think about auth then /execute the solution"  # → analysis → implementation

# Conditional execution flows
"/test login flow and if fails /fix then /pr"  # → test → fix → create PR
```

### Before: Manual Step-by-Step Development
```
1. Analyze the issue manually
2. Write code manually
3. Test manually
4. Create PR manually
5. Handle review comments manually
```

### After: Single Command Workflows (Capital Efficiency in Action)
```bash
/pr "fix authentication bug"     # → think → execute → push → copilot → review
/copilot                        # → analyze PR → fix all issues autonomously
/execute "add user dashboard"   # → plan → auto-approve → implement
/orch "implement notifications" # → multi-agent parallel development
```

### 📈 Capital Efficiency KPIs Applied
- **Utilization Rate**: 99% command execution reliability vs 20% with manual processes
- **Conversion Efficiency**: Autonomous workflows require minimal human intervention
- **Touch Rate**: Low manual correction needed due to systematic automation
- **Value Arbitrage Score**: Complex development workflows at fraction of human consultant cost

## 🔍 Command Deep Dive - The Composition Powerhouses

### `/cerebras` - Hybrid Code Generation (19.6x Faster)

**What It Does**: Revolutionary hybrid workflow using [Cerebras Inference API](https://www.cerebras.ai/inference) for 19.6x faster code generation (500ms vs 10s), with Claude as ARCHITECT and Cerebras as BUILDER.

**Why Cerebras Is Faster**: Cerebras achieves breakthrough performance through their Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-3) with 44GB of on-chip SRAM and 21 petabytes/second memory bandwidth - 7,000x more than traditional GPUs. By storing entire models on-chip, Cerebras eliminates the memory bandwidth bottleneck that limits GPU inference to hundreds of tokens/second, achieving over 2,100 tokens/second on large models.

**Hybrid Architecture**:
1. **Claude Analysis**: Requirements analysis and detailed specification creation
2. **Prompt Generation**: Claude creates precise, structured prompts with full context
3. **Cerebras Execution**: High-speed code generation at 500ms response time using Wafer Scale Engine
4. **Claude Integration**: Verification, integration, and quality assurance
5. **Decision Logging**: Automatic documentation in `docs/{branch}/cerebras_decisions.md`

**Perfect For**: Well-defined code generation, boilerplate, templates, unit tests, algorithms, documentation, repetitive patterns

**Real Example**:
```bash
/cerebras "create React component for user dashboard with TypeScript"
↓
Claude: Analyzes requirements → Creates detailed specification
Cerebras: Generates component code at 19.6x speed (500ms via WSE-3)
Claude: Integrates, validates, and documents decision
```

**Speed Comparison**:
- **Standard Claude**: ~10 seconds for complex code generation
- **Cerebras Hybrid**: ~500ms for same generation (19.6x faster)
- **Technical Advantage**: 2,100+ tokens/second vs GPU's ~hundreds of tokens/second
- **Quality**: Same high-quality output with architectural oversight

### `/execute` - Plan-Approve-Execute Composition

**What It Does**: Combines `/plan` → `/preapprove` → `/autoapprove` → execute in one seamless workflow with TodoWrite tracking.

**3-Phase Workflow**:
1. **Planning Phase**: Executes `/plan` command - creates TodoWrite checklist and displays execution plan
2. **Approval Chain**: `/preapprove` validation followed by `/autoapprove` with message "User already approves - proceeding with execution"
3. **Implementation**: Systematic execution following the approved plan with progress updates

**Real Example**:
```bash
/execute "fix login button styling"
↓
Phase 1 - Planning (/plan): Creates TodoWrite checklist and execution plan
Phase 2 - Approval Chain: /preapprove → /autoapprove → "User already approves - proceeding"
Phase 3 - Implementation: [Check styles → Update CSS → Test → Commit]
```

### `/plan` - Manual Approval Development Planning

**What It Does**: Structured development planning with explicit user approval gates.

**Perfect For**: Complex architectural changes, high-risk modifications, learning new patterns.

**Workflow**:
1. **Deep Analysis**: Research existing system, constraints, requirements
2. **Multi-Approach Planning**: Present 2-3 different implementation approaches
3. **Resource Assessment**: Timeline, complexity, tool requirements, risk analysis
4. **Approval Gate**: User must explicitly approve before implementation
5. **Guided Execution**: Step-by-step implementation with checkpoints

### `/pr` - Complete Development Lifecycle

**What It Does**: Executes the complete 5-phase development lifecycle: `/think` → `/execute` → `/push` → `/copilot` → `/review`

**Mandatory 5-Phase Workflow**:
```
Phase 1: Think - Strategic analysis and approach planning
↓
Phase 2: Execute - Implementation using /execute workflow
↓
Phase 3: Push - Commit, push, and create PR with details
↓
Phase 4: Copilot - Auto-executed PR analysis and issue fixing
↓
Phase 5: Review - Comprehensive code review and validation
```

**Real Example**:
```bash
/pr "fix login timeout issue"
↓
Think: Analyze login flow and timeout causes →
Execute: Implement timeout fix systematically →
Push: Create PR with comprehensive details →
Copilot: Fix any automated feedback →
Review: Complete code review and validation
```

### `/copilot` - Universal PR Composition with Execute

**What It Does**: Targets current branch PR by default, delegates to `/execute` for intelligent 6-phase autonomous workflow.

**6-Phase Autonomous System**:
1. **PR Analysis**: Status check, CI analysis, comment gathering
2. **Issue Detection**: Systematic problem identification and prioritization
3. **Automated Resolution**: Intelligent fixing with `/execute` optimization
4. **Quality Assurance**: Test coverage, lint validation, self-review
5. **Communication**: Reply to comments, update PR descriptions
6. **Validation**: Final verification and completion confirmation

**Perfect For**: Full autonomous PR management without manual intervention.

**Real Example**:
```bash
/copilot  # Auto-targets current branch PR
↓
🎯 Targeting current branch PR: #123 →
🚀 Delegating to /execute for intelligent workflow →
Analyze → Fix → Test → Document → Reply → Verify
```

### `/orch` - Multi-Agent Task Delegation System

**What It Does**: Delegates tasks to autonomous tmux-based agents working in parallel across different branches.

**Multi-Agent Architecture**:
- **Frontend Agent**: UI/UX implementation, browser testing, styling
- **Backend Agent**: API development, database integration, server logic
- **Testing Agent**: Test automation, validation, performance testing
- **Opus-Master**: Architecture decisions, code review, integration

**Real Example**:
```bash
/orch "add user notifications system"
↓
Frontend Agent: notification UI components (parallel)
Backend Agent: notification API endpoints (parallel)
Testing Agent: notification test suite (parallel)
Opus-Master: architecture review and integration
↓
All agents work independently → Create individual PRs → Integration verification
```

**Cost**: $0.003-$0.050 per task (highly efficient)

**Monitoring**:
```bash
/orch monitor agents    # Check agent status
/orch "What's running?" # Current task overview
tmux attach-session -t task-agent-frontend  # Direct agent access
```

## 💡 The Composition Architecture - How It Actually Works

### The Hook Mechanism

Each command is a **simple .md file** that Claude Code reads as executable instructions. When you type `/pr "fix bug"`, Claude:

1. **Reads** `.claude/commands/pr.md`
2. **Parses** the structured prompt template
3. **Executes** the workflow defined in the markdown
4. **Composes** with other commands through shared protocols

### Multi-Command Chaining in Single Sentences

You can chain multiple commands in one request:

```bash
# Sequential execution
"/think about authentication then /arch the solution then /execute it"

# Conditional execution
"/test the login flow and if it fails /fix it then /pr the changes"

# Parallel analysis
"/debug the performance issue while /research best practices then /plan implementation"

# Full workflow composition
"/analyze the codebase /design a solution /execute with tests /pr with documentation then /copilot any issues"
```
