## 🛡️ Solo Developer Security Focus

### **Trusted Source Detection & Context-Aware Analysis**

The `/reviewdeep` command now implements intelligent context detection to distinguish between trusted and untrusted data sources, providing security analysis appropriate for solo developers:

### **Trusted Sources (Reduced Enterprise Paranoia)**
- **GitHub API responses** - Skip JSON schema validation for official GitHub API endpoints
- **Package managers** - npm, PyPI, Maven, NuGet from official registries
- **CDN providers** - cdnjs, unpkg, jsdelivr, and other established CDNs
- **Official documentation** - Framework docs, language specifications
- **Verified open source** - Projects with good reputation and security track record

### **Untrusted Sources (Full Security Analysis)**
- **User input** - Web forms, file uploads, command line arguments
- **External APIs** - Third-party services without verification
- **Dynamic code** - eval(), exec(), and code generation
- **File system access** - User-controlled paths and file operations
- **Database queries** - Dynamic SQL with user input

### **Security Focus Areas (Solo Developer Priorities)**

#### ✅ **ALWAYS ANALYZED** - Real Security Vulnerabilities
1. **Command Injection** - Unsanitized user input in system commands, shell=True risks
2. **Credential Exposure** - Hardcoded secrets, API keys in code, .env file issues
3. **Path Traversal** - User-controlled file paths, directory traversal vulnerabilities
4. **SQL Injection** - Dynamic queries without parameterization
5. **XSS Vulnerabilities** - Unsanitized output in web applications
6. **Authentication Flaws** - Session handling, password storage issues
7. **CSRF Vulnerabilities** - Missing CSRF tokens in state-changing operations

#### ❌ **FILTERED OUT** - Enterprise Paranoia (For Trusted Sources Only)
1. **JSON Schema Validation** - For trusted APIs like GitHub, npm registry
2. **Excessive Input Validation** - For verified package responses
3. **Theoretical Attack Vectors** - Low-probability scenarios with negligible real-world risk
4. **Complex Retry Patterns** - Over-engineered error handling for simple use cases
5. **Enterprise Compliance** - SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS unless specifically requested
6. **Over-Architected Security** - Complex patterns for simple solo developer needs

### **Context Detection Logic**

```markdown
IF data_source IN trusted_sources:
    SKIP enterprise_paranoia_checks
    FOCUS ON implementation_vulnerabilities
    VALIDATE integration_points_only
ELSE:
    APPLY full_security_analysis
    REPORT all_vulnerability_categories
    PROVIDE detailed_risk_assessment
END
```

### **Solo Developer Configuration**

- Resource-efficient execution

**Important**: Each command must be executed with the same target parameter. If no target is provided, all commands operate on the current branch/PR.

## Examples

```bash
# Review current branch/PR with solo developer security focus (most common usage)
/reviewdeep
# This executes: /guidelines → PARALLEL(/cerebras technical + /arch deep) → /reviewe → synthesis + SOLO DEV FILTERING
/reviewd

# Review a specific PR with solo developer context detection
/reviewdeep 592
# Automatically detects trusted sources (GitHub API calls) and filters enterprise paranoia
/reviewd #592

# Review a file with context-aware security analysis
/reviewdeep ".claude/commands/pr.py"
# Analyzes real vulnerabilities, skips theoretical concerns for solo developers
/reviewd "GitHub integration feature"

# Override for enterprise-level analysis (when needed)
/reviewdeep --enterprise-mode "security-critical-feature"
# Disables trusted source filtering, applies full enterprise security checks
```

## Review Principles & Philosophy

### Core Principles (Applied During Analysis) - Solo Developer Focus
- **Verify Before Modify**: Ensure bugs are reproduced and root causes understood before suggesting fixes
- **Incremental and Isolated Changes**: Recommend small, atomic modifications that can be tested independently
- **Test-Driven Resolution**: Suggest writing tests for bug scenarios before implementing fixes
- **Practical Security**: Focus on real vulnerabilities (command injection, credential exposure) over theoretical concerns
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Distinguish trusted sources (GitHub API, npm registry) from untrusted user input
- **Solo Developer Appropriate**: Filter enterprise paranoia, focus on exploitable vulnerabilities
- **Defensive Validation**: Recommend input checks for untrusted sources, skip excessive validation for trusted APIs
- **Fail Fast, Fail Loud**: No silent fallbacks - errors should be explicit and actionable

### Development Tenets (Beliefs That Guide Reviews) - Solo Developer Context
- **Bugs Are Opportunities**: Each issue is a chance to enhance robustness, not just patch symptoms
- **Prevention Over Cure**: Prioritize practices that avoid bugs (code reuse, proper abstractions)
- **Simplicity Wins**: Simpler code is less error-prone - avoid over-engineering and enterprise paranoia
- **Practical Security First**: Real vulnerabilities matter more than theoretical compliance concerns
- **Trust Context Matters**: GitHub API responses don't need JSON schema validation, user input does need sanitization
- **CI Parity Is Sacred**: All code must run deterministically in CI vs local environments
- **Solo Developer Realism**: Balance security with development velocity appropriate for solo/small teams
- **Continuous Learning**: Document patterns from failures to prevent recurrence

### Quality Goals (What Reviews Aim For)
- **Zero Regressions**: Ensure changes don't introduce new bugs
- **High Code Coverage**: Recommend 80-90% test coverage for critical paths
- **Maintainable Codebase**: Fixes should improve readability and modularity
- **Fast MTTR**: Issues should be resolvable within hours with proper documentation
- **Reduced Bug Density**: Lower bugs per 1000 lines through preventive patterns

### 6. **Testing & CI Safety Analysis** (Enhanced from /reviewe)
Building on the code-level checks from `/reviewe`, this phase analyzes system-wide patterns:

- **Subprocess Discipline at Scale**: System-wide timeout enforcement patterns
- **Skip Pattern Elimination**: Zero tolerance policy enforcement across entire codebase
- **CI Parity Validation**: Test infrastructure consistency analysis
- **Resource Management Patterns**: System-level cleanup strategies
- **Input Sanitization Architecture**: Security patterns across all entry points
- **Error Handling Philosophy**: Consistent error propagation strategies

## 🚨 CRITICAL: PR Guidelines Generation Protocol

### **Automatic Guidelines Creation**
`/reviewdeep` automatically generates PR-specific guidelines based on review findings:

**PR Context Detection**:
- **Primary**: Auto-detect PR number from current branch context via GitHub API
- **Fallback 1**: Extract from branch name patterns (e.g., `pr-1286-feature`, `fix-1286-bug`)
- **Fallback 2**: If no PR context, create branch-specific guidelines in `docs/branch-guidelines/{BRANCH_NAME}/guidelines.md`
- **Fallback 3**: If outside any PR/branch context (e.g., file/feature targets), skip guidelines generation and continue with analysis only
- **Manual Override**: Accept explicit PR number via `/reviewdeep --pr 1286`
- **Graceful Degradation**: Never fail /reviewdeep execution due to guidelines generation issues - log warning and proceed

**File Location**:
- **With PR**: `docs/pr-guidelines/{PR_NUMBER}/guidelines.md` (e.g., `docs/pr-guidelines/1286/guidelines.md`)
- **Without PR**: `docs/branch-guidelines/{BRANCH_NAME}/guidelines.md` (e.g., `docs/branch-guidelines/feature-auth/guidelines.md`)

**Generation Process**:
1. **Analyze Review Findings**: Extract patterns from `/reviewe`, `/arch`, and `/thinku` analysis
2. **Identify Mistake Patterns**: Document specific issues found in the PR
3. **Create Solutions**: Provide ❌ wrong vs ✅ correct examples with code snippets
4. **Generate Anti-Patterns**: Structure findings as reusable anti-patterns for future prevention
5. **Document Context**: Include PR-specific context and historical references

### **Guidelines Content Structure**
Generated guidelines file includes:

```markdown
# PR #{PR_NUMBER} Guidelines - {PR_TITLE}

## 🎯 PR-Specific Principles
