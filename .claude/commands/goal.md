# /goal - Goal Definition and Validation Command

**Purpose**: Define, track, and validate complex goals with structured success criteria and progress monitoring.

## Usage
- `/goal <goal_definition>` - Define a new goal with automatic success criteria extraction
- `/goal --template <template_name>` - Use predefined goal template with optimized criteria
- `/goal --validate` - Validate current goal completion status objectively
- `/goal --current` - Display active goal details and progress
- `/goal --clear` - Clear current goal and reset tracking
- `/goal --history` - Show completed goals and success rates

## Core Functionality

### Goal Definition Protocol
When defining a new goal, the system:

1. **Goal Processing**: Use direct analysis for structured goal processing
   - **Method**: Inline goal analysis with structured output
   - **Output**: Structured goal analysis with success criteria
   - **Benefits**: Direct processing, persistent storage, standardized format

2. **Memory MCP Integration with Query Optimization**: Search and integrate with persistent knowledge using enhanced effectiveness
   - **Universal Composition**: Use `/memory search` for automatic query optimization and improved goal pattern discovery
   - **Smart Search Strategy**: Leverage `/memory` command's automatic compound query transformation
   - **Command**: `/memory search "related goals and patterns"` - Search with built-in optimization
   - **Command**: `/memory recall "historical goal contexts"` - Retrieve specific goal learnings
   - **Result Merging**: Automatic through `/memory` command's built-in deduplication and scoring
   - Extract similar goal patterns and success strategies from enhanced memory retrieval
   - Identify anti-patterns and failure modes from improved search results
   - **Performance Enhancement**: Improve goal pattern discovery from ~30% to 70%+ success rate

3. **Guidelines Consultation**: **Command**: `/guidelines` - Consult mistake prevention system before goal processing
   - Apply CLAUDE.md rules and constraints to goal definition
   - Check PR-specific guidelines for context-aware goal setting
   - Use base guidelines for goal quality standards and anti-patterns
   - Ensure goal aligns with project protocols and best practices

4. **Process Goal Structure**: Parse structured goal specification
5. **Validate and Enhance**: Verify output and add context-specific enhancements
6. **Memory Persistence**: Captures goal definition in persistent knowledge graph with machine-readable patterns
   - **Command**: `mcp__memory-server__create_entities` - Create goal entity with structured metadata
     - **Entity Type**: `goal_pattern` with template classification and complexity scoring
     - **Structured Metadata**: Goal type, success criteria count, estimated complexity, template used
   - **Command**: `mcp__memory-server__create_relations` - Link to related projects, patterns, and contexts
     - **Pattern Relations**: Links to similar goals, template usage, success/failure patterns
     - **Context Relations**: PR numbers, project phases, team members, timeline constraints
   - **Command**: `mcp__memory-server__add_observations` - Store goal definition, criteria, and analysis
     - **Machine-Readable Format**: JSON structure with goal classification, success predictors, failure modes
     - **Pattern Recognition**: Template effectiveness, criteria validation rates, convergence indicators
7. **Stores Goal Context**: Saves goal.md file with complete specification (guidelines-compliant structure)

### Goal Storage Structure
Goals are stored in `goals/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-[slug]/` with:
- `00-goal-definition.md` - Original goal statement and auto-generated criteria
- `01-success-criteria.md` - Measurable validation points
- `02-progress-tracking.md` - Current status and completion percentage
- `03-validation-log.md` - Historical validation attempts and results
- `metadata.json` - Status, timestamps, and configuration

### Automatic Success Criteria Generation

**Pattern Recognition**: Automatically identifies success criteria from goal language:
- File operations → "File exists with correct content"
- Test requirements → "All tests pass"
- PR operations → "PR in correct state (OPEN/MERGED/CLOSED)"
- Implementation tasks → "Feature works as specified"
- Bug fixes → "Issue no longer occurs"

**Examples**:
```markdown
Goal: "Create authentication system with tests"
Auto-generated criteria:
✅ Authentication system implemented and functional
✅ All authentication tests pass
✅ Security requirements met
✅ Integration with existing codebase complete
```

## /goal --validate Implementation

### Validation Process
1. **Memory Context Retrieval**: Load relevant validation patterns and historical data
   - **Command**: `/memory search "validation scenarios and outcomes"` - Find similar patterns with optimization
   - **Command**: `/memory recall "validation methods and success patterns"` - Retrieve specific validation contexts
   - Apply learned validation strategies from successful goal completions
   - Identify common validation failure points and mitigation strategies

2. **Guidelines Consultation**: **Command**: `/guidelines` - Consult mistake prevention guidelines before validation
   - Apply validation standards from base and PR-specific guidelines
   - Use evidence-based development patterns for validation methods
   - Follow tool selection hierarchy (Serena MCP → Read tool → Bash commands)
   - Apply systematic change management principles to validation process

3. **Load Active Goal**: Read current goal specification and success criteria
4. **Systematic Validation**: Check each success criterion objectively (per guidelines standards and memory patterns)
5. **Evidence Collection**: Gather concrete evidence for each validation point (following evidence protocols)
6. **Status Calculation**: Determine completion percentage and overall status
7. **Memory Learning**: Capture validation results and patterns in persistent knowledge
   - **Command**: `mcp__memory-server__add_observations` - Store validation evidence and outcomes
   - **Command**: `mcp__memory-server__create_relations` - Link validation patterns to goal success/failure
   - Update goal entity with completion status and validation learnings
8. **Update Progress**: Record validation results and current state (guidelines-compliant documentation)

### Validation Methods by Criteria Type
- **File Existence**: Use Read tool to verify file presence and content
- **Test Completion**: Run test commands and analyze results
- **PR Status**: Query GitHub API for current PR state
- **Feature Functionality**: Execute feature tests and validate behavior
- **Integration Status**: Check system integration points and compatibility

### Validation Output Format
```markdown
## Goal Validation Report
**Goal**: [Original goal statement]
**Validation Date**: [Current timestamp]
**Overall Status**: CONVERGED ✅ / CONVERGING 🔄 / STALLED ⚠️ / BLOCKED 🛑

### Success Criteria Results:
1. ✅ [Criterion 1]: Evidence - [Specific validation proof]
2. 🔄 [Criterion 2]: Partial - [Current progress and remaining work]
3. ❌ [Criterion 3]: Failed - [Specific failure reason and fix needed]

**Completion**: 67% (2/3 criteria met)
**Next Actions**: [Specific steps to address remaining criteria]
```

## Goal Persistence and History

### Active Goal Tracking
- Only one goal active at a time
- Current goal stored in `goals/.current-goal`
- All validation attempts logged with timestamps
- Progress tracked continuously until completion
- **Memory Integration**: Active goal linked to persistent knowledge graph

### Goal History with Memory MCP
- **Memory Persistence**: All goals stored in persistent knowledge graph with rich metadata
  - **Command**: `mcp__memory-server__create_entities` - Goal entities with completion status and metrics
  - **Command**: `mcp__memory-server__create_relations` - Relationships between goals, strategies, and outcomes
  - **Command**: `mcp__memory-server__add_observations` - Detailed success/failure patterns and learnings
- **Pattern Recognition**: Memory MCP enables cross-goal pattern analysis
  - Success rate correlation with goal types and complexity
  - Validation method effectiveness across different goal categories
  - Common failure patterns and successful mitigation strategies
- **Learning Integration**: Historical insights automatically inform new goal definitions
  - Similar goal detection and strategy recommendation
  - Anti-pattern prevention based on previous failures
  - Success criteria optimization using proven patterns

## Configuration Options

### Goal Defaults
```json
{
  "max_validation_attempts": 50,
  "auto_criteria_generation": true,
  "evidence_collection": "automatic",
  "progress_tracking": "continuous",
  "completion_threshold": 100
}
```

### Validation Settings
- **Strict Mode**: 100% criteria completion required
- **Partial Mode**: Accept high percentage completion (>90%)
- **Evidence Level**: Minimum evidence required per criterion
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry on validation failures

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios
- **No Active Goal**: Prompts to define goal first
- **Validation Failures**: Provides specific failure reasons and suggested fixes
- **Criteria Ambiguity**: Requests clarification or provides interpretation
- **Evidence Collection Issues**: Falls back to alternative validation methods

### Graceful Degradation
- Missing validation tools → Use available alternatives
- API failures → Cache previous results and note limitations
- File access issues → Report specific problems and continue with accessible criteria
- Network issues → Use local validation where possible

---

**Implementation Method**: This command provides structured goal definition and validation that integrates with /converge for systematic goal achievement tracking.
