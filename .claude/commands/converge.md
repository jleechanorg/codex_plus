# /converge - Iterative Goal Achievement Command

Achieve complex goals through autonomous plan-execute-validate-learn cycles until success criteria are met.

## Usage
- `/converge <goal>` - Start converging toward a specific goal
- `/converge --max-iterations N` - Set custom iteration limit (default: 10)
- `/converge --goal-integration` - Use /goal command for structured goal definition
- `/converge` - Resume previous convergence if interrupted

## Core Pattern
```
Loop: Autonomous plan→execute→validate→learn cycles
Until: Success criteria fully met
```

## 🔄 CONTINUOUS CONVERGENCE PROTOCOL

**FULLY AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM**: /converge implements a completely autonomous, self-improving system through recursive goal achievement with persistent learning and systematic iteration. **ZERO USER INTERVENTION** required after initial goal statement.

### 🎯 GOAL & SUCCESS CRITERIA DEFINITION
**MANDATORY**: All /converge operations must use structured goal integration

**Command**: `/goal` - Define goal with structured success criteria and validation framework
- Automatic success criteria generation based on goal patterns
- Integrated validation system with evidence collection
- Guidelines consultation for goal quality and compliance
- Historical tracking and learning integration with Memory MCP
- Cross-goal pattern analysis and optimization

### 🗺️ CONVERGENCE LOOP (9-STEP CYCLE)
**LOOP UNTIL CONVERGED OR MAX ITERATIONS REACHED (Default: 10 iterations)**:

#### Step 1: Intelligent Autonomous Goal Definition and Context Setup
**Command**: Goal Processing - Intelligently define goals with smart defaults and autonomous analysis
- **ENHANCED CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION**: Use direct goal processing for minimal context consumption
- **Method**: Direct inline goal analysis with structured output
- **Output**: Structured goal-spec.json in /tmp/converge/{branch}/session-{timestamp}/
- **Context Savings**: Optimized direct processing approach
- **Integration**: Load goal specification for subsequent phases without accumulating context
- **Benefits**: Direct processing, structured analysis, persistent storage
- Generate structured success criteria based on goal analysis and pattern recognition
- Establish validation methods and completion thresholds using established frameworks
- Create goal tracking structure with evidence requirements following proven patterns

#### Step 2: Strategic Planning and Tool Analysis
**Command**: `/plan` - Create comprehensive strategy with command index optimization
- **CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION**: Use command index instead of reading full .claude/commands/ files
- **Command Index**: Load /tmp/converge/{branch}/command-cache/index.json (71K chars vs 677K chars)
- **Context Savings**: 89.5% reduction in command discovery phase
- **Smart Selection**: Filter commands by context level, execution time, and goal type
- **Lazy Loading**: Defer reading full command .md files until execution phase
- **Efficiency**: Use command summaries for planning, full docs for execution only
- Remember slash commands are EXECUTABLE instructions, not documentation
- Break goal into actionable phases using appropriate slash command orchestration
- Estimate resource requirements and timeline with tool-specific considerations
- Identify potential obstacles and mitigation strategies
- Create detailed TodoWrite tracking system with command-specific tasks

#### Step 3: Plan Review & Confidence Assessment
**Action**: Review the plan using strategic analysis with confidence scoring
- Critically analyze plan against available slash command library
- **Confidence Assessment**: Evaluate goal clarity, pattern recognition, and complexity
  - **High (≥75%)**: Clear goal + recognizable patterns → Standard execution
  - **Medium (50-74%)**: Some ambiguity → Enhanced logging, continue
  - **Low (<50%)**: Major uncertainty → Extra validation, continue
- Display confidence level with reasoning for transparency
- Optimize tool selection for maximum efficiency
- Identify command synergies and integration opportunities
- Validate approach against best practices and constraints

#### Step 4: Plan Approval
**AUTONOMOUS APPROVAL**: All plans are automatically approved and proceed without human intervention
- System confidence assessment determines execution approach
- High-confidence plans: Proceed with optimal execution strategy
- Lower-confidence plans: Use more conservative execution with additional validation
- All plans proceed autonomously - no human approval gates

#### Step 5: Execution Phase
**Command**: `/cerebras` to execute (or appropriate command based on goal type)
- Execute plan using optimal slash command selection
- Monitor progress and adapt execution as needed
- Handle errors and obstacles with intelligent retry
- Maintain detailed execution logs for learning

#### Step 6: Validation Against Goals
**Command**: `/goal --validate` against the goals - Objective success measurement
- Check each success criterion systematically using structured validation
- Measure progress quantitatively with evidence collection
- Identify gaps between actual and expected outcomes
- Document validation results with concrete evidence for learning phase
- Generate completion percentage and remaining work analysis

#### Step 7: Learning & Documentation Update
**Command**: `/guidelines` to update the documentation if mistakes/learnings were made
- Capture mistakes, inefficiencies, and unexpected successes
- Update project guidelines and best practices
- Evolve meta-rules for future convergence cycles
- Create persistent memory for recursive improvement

#### Step 8: Enhanced Status Report Generation
**Command**: `/status` - Generate comprehensive convergence status report with confidence data
- **Report Location**: Save to `docs/pr-guidelines/{PR_NUMBER}/convergence-status-{timestamp}.md`
- **Progress Summary**: Current completion percentage and criteria status
- **Confidence Data**: Current confidence level, reasoning, and historical accuracy
- **Resource Summary**: Token usage, iterations completed, elapsed time
- **Iteration Analysis**: Commands used, success rates, and performance metrics
- **Learning Documentation**: Patterns discovered, failures overcome, optimizations applied
- **Convergence Trajectory**: Progress velocity, estimated completion, next iteration strategy
- **Decision Context**: Evidence for convergence/continuation decision with objective rationale

#### Step 9: Convergence Decision
**LOOP CONTROL**: Start again with Step 1 (Goal Definition) and loop N times or stop when it's done

🚨 **MANDATORY AUTONOMY CHECKPOINT**: Before making convergence decision, verify autonomy preservation:
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Stopping for user approval when goal not 100% achieved
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Waiting for user acknowledgment of partial progress
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Implicit approval requests through progress celebration
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Continue immediately if success criteria < 100% and iterations < max

**Convergence Decision Logic**:
- **IF CONVERGED**: All PRIMARY success criteria met → STOP with completion report
  - PR is MERGEABLE status (not conflicting)
  - All SERIOUS GitHub comments addressed (blocking issues resolved)
  - CI passes (no failed checks)
  - No critical errors or failures detected
- **IF GOOD ENOUGH**: Core objectives achieved even if minor issues remain → STOP
  - Primary goal accomplished (90%+ criteria met)
  - Diminishing returns threshold reached (last 2 iterations <5% improvement)
  - PR is in good mergeable state with only cosmetic issues remaining

  **Threshold Definitions:**
  - **"90%+ criteria met"**: Calculate as (number of primary success criteria achieved) / (total number of primary success criteria). For example, if there are 10 criteria and 9 are met, progress = 90%. Criteria may include PR mergeability, CI passing, blocking comments resolved, etc.
  - **"Last 2 iterations <5% improvement"**: Measure progress using a quantifiable validation score (e.g., percentage of criteria met, CI pass rate, or resolved blocking issues). If the increase in score between the last two iterations is less than 5% (e.g., from 88% to 90%), this threshold is considered reached.
  - **Example**: If in iteration 8, 8/10 criteria are met (80%), and in iteration 9, 9/10 are met (90%), the improvement is 10%. If in iteration 10, 9.5/10 are met (95%), the improvement is 5%. If subsequent iterations show <5% improvement, convergence is triggered.
- **IF STALLED**: No meaningful progress in validation for 2+ iterations → STOP with stall report
  - Same validation scores for 2+ consecutive iterations
  - Unable to improve PR mergeability status
  - Repeated execution failures on same issue
- **IF IMPROVING**: Meaningful progress on PRIMARY criteria → Continue (up to 2 more iterations, but never exceeding the hard cap)
  - Measurable improvement in PR status or CI state
  - Successful resolution of blocking GitHub comments
  - NOTE: The hard cap of 10 iterations always applies, overriding all other limits
- **IF MAX ITERATIONS**: Absolute limit reached → STOP with partial report

🔒 **AUTONOMY PRESERVATION**: No user intervention allowed during convergence decision process

**PR CONTEXT AWARENESS**: When goal involves PR work:
- Primary success = PR is MERGEABLE on current branch
- ❌ NEVER create additional PRs as "solutions"
- ✅ ALWAYS work within existing PR constraints
- ✅ STAY ON CURRENT BRANCH throughout convergence

## 🚀 Context Optimization Architecture

### Lazy Loading Patterns
**Context-Efficient File Loading**: Load files only when needed for execution, not during planning

```markdown
**Planning Phase** (Steps 1-3):
- Goal Processing: Use independent agent (5K tokens max)
- Command Discovery: Use command index (71K chars vs 677K chars)
- Plan Review: Work with summaries only
- Context Usage: ~80K tokens (vs 200K+ traditional)

**Execution Phase** (Steps 5+):
- Command Details: Load full .md files only when executing specific commands
- File Operations: Read files on-demand during actual operations
- Resource Usage: Targeted loading based on execution needs
- Context Management: Release completed context between iterations
```

### Command Index System Integration
**89.5% Context Reduction in Command Discovery**:
- **Index Location**: `/tmp/converge/{branch}/command-cache/index.json`
- **Content**: 106 command summaries with purpose, context requirements, execution time
- **Usage**: Planning phase uses index, execution phase loads full command docs
- **Benefits**: Instant command discovery, smart filtering, parallel planning capability

### Agent-Based Architecture
**Independent Processing Agents**:
- **Goal Processing**: Direct inline goal analysis with structured output
- **Planning Agent**: Future enhancement for command selection and sequencing
- **Execution Agents**: Parallel task execution with minimal shared context
- **Validation Agent**: Success criteria checking with targeted file access

### Session State Management
**Filesystem-Based Coordination**:
```
/tmp/converge/{branch_name}/
├── session-{timestamp}/
│   ├── goal-spec.json          # Goal processor output
│   ├── execution-plan.json     # Planning phase results
│   ├── current-state.json      # Progress tracking
│   └── results/               # Execution outputs
└── command-cache/             # Command index system
    └── index.json
```

## Best Practices
1. **Start with clear success criteria** - Ambiguous goals lead to endless loops
2. **Use TodoWrite for tracking** - Maintains visibility of progress
3. **Leverage parallel execution** - Use orchestration for independent tasks
4. **Validate frequently** - Don't wait until the end to check progress
5. **Document decisions** - Keep audit trail of what was tried
6. **Know when to stop** - Set maximum iterations to prevent infinite loops
7. **🚀 NEW: Optimize context usage** - Use lazy loading and agent architecture for efficiency
8. **🚀 NEW: Leverage command index** - Use summaries for planning, full docs for execution

## 🎯 CORRECTED ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

**Universal Composition**: /converge systematically calls other slash commands using explicit "**Command**: /commandname" pattern

**Iterative Convergence**: Continues plan→execute→validate→learn cycles until ALL success criteria met

**Measurable Success**: Verifies completion objectively, not through assumption

**Command Integration**: Uses appropriate specialist commands (/cerebras, /copilot, /test, /orch) based on goal type

**Remember**: /converge achieves goals by orchestrating other slash commands intelligently, not by trying to do everything itself. It's a meta-command that coordinates specialized tools until convergence is achieved.
