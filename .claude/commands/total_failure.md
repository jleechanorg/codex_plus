# Total Failure Protocol

**Usage**: `/total_failure` or referenced by other commands

**Purpose**: Define zero tolerance success criteria for all tasks, debugging, and testing operations.

## üö® TOTAL FAILURE PROTOCOL

### ‚ö° ZERO TOLERANCE FOR PARTIAL SUCCESS
**ABSOLUTE RULE: NO CELEBRATIONS UNTIL ORIGINAL PROBLEM IS 100% SOLVED**
- ‚ùå NO "partial success" acknowledgments
- ‚ùå NO "mostly working" statements until SPECIFIC issue is resolved
- ‚ùå NO "good progress" claims until ORIGINAL REQUEST is complete
- ‚ùå NO stopping early with "this tells us valuable information" - THAT IS FAILURE
- ‚ùå NO claiming progress until exact issue is resolved

### üéØ BRUTAL SUCCESS CRITERIA
**ONLY SUCCESS:** The exact user request or test specification is completely fulfilled
- **ANYTHING LESS IS TOTAL FAILURE:** No exceptions, no excuses, no partial credit
- **BE RUTHLESSLY HONEST:** If original problem isn't solved, the task FAILED
- **BUILD MUST WORK:** If code doesn't compile or tests fail, it's complete failure
- **USER REQUEST MUST BE 100% COMPLETE:** Anything working less than 100% = TOTAL FAILURE

### üö® BINARY OUTCOME ENFORCEMENT
- **100% Working = SUCCESS**
- **99% Working = TOTAL FAILURE**
- **No middle ground, no partial credit**
- **Zero tolerance for "almost there" or "mostly fixed"**

### üìã APPLICATION AREAS
This protocol applies to:
- **All testing operations** (`/testllm`, `/test`, browser automation)
- **All debugging tasks** (`/debug`, `/debugp`, issue resolution)
- **All user requests** (feature implementation, bug fixes, code changes)
- **All build operations** (compilation, deployment, CI/CD)
- **All validation steps** (code review, quality checks, integration tests)

### üîß ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
- **Pre-completion checkpoint**: "Is the original problem 100% solved?"
- **Binary evaluation**: No scoring, no percentages - only PASS/FAIL
- **Evidence requirement**: Concrete proof of 100% functionality required
- **Zero exceptions**: No circumstances justify partial success declaration

### üö® FORBIDDEN LANGUAGE PATTERNS
‚ùå **NEVER SAY:**
- "Mostly working"
- "Almost there"
- "Good progress"
- "Partial success"
- "99% complete"
- "Just need to fix one small thing"
- "This tells us valuable information" (without solving original problem)

‚úÖ **ONLY ACCEPTABLE:**
- "100% WORKING" (with evidence)
- "TOTAL FAILURE" (when anything less than 100%)

### üìñ COMMAND INTEGRATION
Commands that enforce Total Failure Protocol:
- `/testllm` - Testing operations
- `/debugp` - Debug protocol
- `/debug-protocol` - Forensic debugging
- All commands in `.claude/commands/` that declare success/failure

## Meta-Protocol

This Total Failure Protocol is the foundational success criteria for all operations. Commands reference this document rather than duplicating the language.
