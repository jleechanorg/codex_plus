# /fixprc - Fix PR Comments (Autonomous PR Comment Resolution)

## üéØ Purpose
**Autonomous PR comment fixing system combining convergence + copilot specialized for PR comment resolution**

Similar to `/copilotc` but specifically optimized for PR comment threads, code review feedback, and merge-blocking issues.

## üöÄ Command Architecture - PR-Focused Universal Composition

**Pattern**: Autonomous PR-specific comment resolution system

**Flow**:
```
1. `/conv "fix all PR comments and make PR mergeable"`
2. Auto-execute `/copilot` with PR comment focus for each iteration
3. Continue until PR is clean and mergeable
4. Success when all PR comment threads resolved
```

## üîÑ Autonomous PR Processing Protocol

**FULLY AUTONOMOUS**: This command operates without user intervention until all PR comments are resolved.

### PR-Specialized Implementation

**Phase 1: PR Comment Analysis & Goal Setup**
```bash
# Execute convergence with PR-specific comment resolution goal
/conv "analyze and fix all PR comments, review feedback, and merge-blocking issues"
```

**Phase 2: PR-Focused Copilot Processing**
- Within each convergence iteration, automatically execute `/copilot` with PR focus
- Prioritize merge-blocking comments and review feedback
- Address code quality issues identified in PR comments  
- Handle CI failures and test issues mentioned in comments
- Validate PR mergeable status after each iteration

**Phase 3: PR Merge Readiness Validation**
- Check all PR comment threads for resolution status
- Verify no merge-blocking review feedback remains
- Confirm CI/checks passing (if mentioned in comments)
- Validate PR approval status and mergeable state
- Exit when PR is fully ready for merge

## üéõÔ∏è PR-Specific Configuration

**Default Behavior**: 
- **Max Iterations**: 8 (optimized for PR comment cycles)
- **Success Criteria**: All PR comments resolved + Mergeable status achieved
- **Focus Areas**: Review feedback, merge conflicts, CI issues, code quality

**Custom Usage**:
```bash
/fixprc                     # Use default PR-optimized settings
/fixprc --max-iterations 5  # Custom iteration limit for simple PRs
```

## üö® PR-Focused Autonomous Rules

**PR-CENTRIC CONVERGENCE**: Uses `/conv` with PR-specific success criteria
- **Merge-blocking priority**: Addresses comments preventing merge first
- **Review thread resolution**: Ensures all comment threads properly closed
- **CI integration**: Fixes issues mentioned in automated comments
- **Code quality focus**: Addresses review feedback on code improvements

**SPECIALIZED COPILOT INTEGRATION**: PR comment processing optimization
- **Comment thread tracking**: Systematic processing of all PR comment threads  
- **Review feedback priority**: Addresses human reviewer feedback first
- **Automated comment handling**: Processes bot comments and CI feedback
- **Merge conflict resolution**: Handles merge-related comment issues

## üí° PR-Specific Use Cases

**Perfect for**:
- PRs with extensive review feedback
- PRs blocked by multiple comment threads
- PRs with CI issues mentioned in comments
- Large PRs needing comprehensive comment resolution

**Example PR Scenarios**:
- "Code review requested 15 changes - fix them all"
- "PR has merge conflicts and failing tests"
- "Multiple reviewers left feedback - address everything"
- "CI bot identified security and quality issues"

## ‚ö° PR Processing Performance

**Target Performance**: 
- **Per Iteration**: 2-3 minutes (PR-focused copilot processing)
- **Total Time**: 8-25 minutes (depending on PR comment complexity)
- **Success Rate**: High (specialized for PR comment patterns)

**PR Success Pattern**: Most PRs become mergeable within 3-4 iterations

## üîó Related Commands

- `/copilotc` - General convergent copilot (broader GitHub comment scope)
- `/copilot` - Single-pass fast PR processing
- `/conv` - Base convergence system (autonomous goal achievement)  
- `/pr` - Complete development lifecycle (includes PR creation + processing)

## üéØ PR Success Criteria

**Command completes successfully when**:
1. ‚úÖ All PR comment threads resolved or properly acknowledged
2. ‚úÖ Review feedback fully addressed with code changes
3. ‚úÖ PR shows mergeable status (no conflicts, passing checks)
4. ‚úÖ All merge-blocking issues resolved
5. ‚úÖ PR ready for approval and merge

**Iteration ends when**: Max iterations reached OR PR fully mergeable

## üîÑ Difference from /copilotc

**`/fixprc`** (PR Comment Focused):
- ‚úÖ Specialized for PR comment threads and review feedback
- ‚úÖ Optimized iteration count for PR comment patterns (8 vs 10)
- ‚úÖ Merge-blocking issue prioritization
- ‚úÖ Review thread resolution tracking

**`/copilotc`** (General GitHub Comments):
- ‚úÖ Broader scope including issue comments, discussions
- ‚úÖ General GitHub comment resolution (not just PRs)
- ‚úÖ Standard convergence iteration count (10)
- ‚úÖ General mergeable status validation

## Implementation Notes

**PR-Specialized Composition**: This command uses universal composition optimized for PR comment resolution workflows, with specialized success criteria and validation methods focused on PR merge readiness.

**Context Efficiency**: Inherits convergence system optimizations while adding PR-specific processing patterns for maximum efficiency in comment resolution cycles.
