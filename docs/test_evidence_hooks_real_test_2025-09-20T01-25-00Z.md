# Hooks Real-World Testing Report
## Test Execution: 2025-09-20T01:25:00Z

### Executive Summary
Comprehensive testing of the hooks system revealed critical architecture insights and identified several functional limitations. The hook system operates through two distinct mechanisms with different capabilities and limitations.

### Test Environment
- **Proxy Status**: ‚úÖ Running and responding (http://localhost:10000/health)
- **Environment**: ‚úÖ OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:10000 configured
- **Test Method**: Real codex CLI execution through proxy system
- **Hook Files**: ‚úÖ All test hook files present and correctly configured

### Critical Findings

#### üö® Hook System Architecture Discovery
**TWO DISTINCT HOOK SYSTEMS IDENTIFIED:**

1. **Settings-Based Hook System** (`.codexplus/settings.json`)
   - ‚úÖ **Status**: Configured and loaded successfully
   - ‚úÖ **Evidence**: Proxy logs show "Loaded settings hooks for events: ['PostToolUse', 'PreToolUse', 'Stop', 'UserPromptSubmit']"
   - ‚ùå **Limitation**: Cannot execute Python files with YAML frontmatter due to syntax errors
   - üîß **Issue**: Hook files contain YAML frontmatter causing `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` when executed directly

2. **Python Class-Based Hook System** (YAML frontmatter + Hook classes)
   - ‚ùå **Status**: Frontmatter parsing failing for test hooks
   - ‚ùå **Evidence**: Multiple warnings "No valid frontmatter found in .codexplus/hooks/[hook_name].py"
   - üîß **Root Cause**: Frontmatter parser expects first line to be `---`, but hook files start with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`

### Test Results by Category

#### Test 1: UserPromptSubmit Hook with Additional Context
- **Execution**: ‚úÖ Codex command executed successfully
- **Hook Trigger**: ‚ùå No evidence of UserPromptSubmit hook execution
- **Context Injection**: ‚ùå No additional context detected in response
- **Frontmatter Parsing**: ‚ùå Warning: "No valid frontmatter found in .codexplus/hooks/add_context.py"

#### Test 2: PreToolUse Hook Blocking Mechanism
- **Execution**: ‚úÖ Slash command `/echo test command` executed successfully
- **Hook Trigger**: ‚ùå No marker file created at `/tmp/codex_plus_pretool_blocked`
- **Blocking Mechanism**: ‚ùå Command executed without interruption
- **Settings Configuration**: ‚úÖ PreToolUse hooks loaded with matcher "SlashCommand/.*"
- **Critical Issue**: Hook file cannot be executed due to YAML frontmatter syntax error

#### Test 3: Stop Hook Execution
- **Status**: Not executed due to discovered systemic issues
- **Expected Marker**: `/tmp/codex_plus_stop_marker`
- **Prediction**: Will fail due to same frontmatter/execution issues

#### Test 4: Hook Settings Integration
- **Settings Loading**: ‚úÖ Successfully loaded from `.codexplus/settings.json`
- **Event Registration**: ‚úÖ All events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, UserPromptSubmit) registered
- **Hook Configuration**: ‚úÖ Proper JSON structure with matchers and commands

#### Test 5: YAML Frontmatter Validation
- **Parsing Status**: ‚ùå CRITICAL FAILURE
- **Error Pattern**: Shebang line prevents frontmatter recognition
- **Affected Files**: All test hooks (add_context.py, pretool_block.py, stop_marker.py)
- **Working Example**: `post_add_header.py` has frontmatter after shebang but uses Hook class system

#### Test 6: End-to-End Hook Chain
- **Overall Status**: ‚ùå SYSTEM-WIDE FAILURE
- **Root Cause**: Incompatible hook file format for settings-based execution
- **Impact**: No hooks executed despite proper configuration

### Evidence Collection

#### Proxy Log Evidence
```
2025-09-19 01:59:29,137 - codex_plus.hooks - WARNING - No valid frontmatter found in .codexplus/hooks/add_context.py
2025-09-19 01:59:29,138 - codex_plus.hooks - WARNING - No valid frontmatter found in .codexplus/hooks/pretool_block.py
2025-09-19 01:59:29,141 - codex_plus.hooks - INFO - Loaded settings hooks for events: ['PostToolUse', 'PreToolUse', 'Stop', 'UserPromptSubmit']
```

#### Hook Execution Test Evidence
```bash
$ CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR=/Users/jleechan/projects_other/codex_plus python3 .codexplus/hooks/pretool_block.py
File ".codexplus/hooks/pretool_block.py", line 2
    ---
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

#### Marker File Evidence
- `/tmp/codex_plus_pretool_blocked`: ‚ùå Not created (hook did not execute)
- `/tmp/codex_plus_stop_marker`: ‚ùå Not tested due to systemic failure

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Primary Issue: Hook File Format Incompatibility
The test hooks were designed with YAML frontmatter format suitable for the Python class-based hook system:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
---
name: pretool-block
type: PreToolUse
priority: 50
enabled: true
---
import sys
# hook code
```

However, the settings-based hook system expects directly executable Python files without frontmatter.

#### Secondary Issue: Frontmatter Parser Limitation
The YAML frontmatter parser in `hooks.py` expects frontmatter to start on the first line, but fails when shebang lines are present.

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Fixes Required

1. **Fix Hook File Format for Settings-Based Execution**
   - Remove YAML frontmatter from settings-based hooks
   - Create pure Python executable files
   - Alternative: Update settings to use wrapper scripts

2. **Improve Frontmatter Parser Robustness**
   - Modify `_parse_frontmatter()` to skip shebang lines
   - Support frontmatter starting after `#!/usr/bin/env python3`

3. **Clarify Hook System Documentation**
   - Document two distinct hook systems
   - Provide clear examples for each approach
   - Specify when to use each system

#### Validation Status Against Test Criteria

**Success Indicators**: ‚ùå FAILED
- [ ] ‚ùå Hooks load without frontmatter warnings (FAILED - multiple warnings)
- [ ] ‚ùå UserPromptSubmit hooks can inject additional context (NOT TESTED - hook didn't execute)
- [ ] ‚ùå PreToolUse hooks can block tool execution when configured (FAILED - hook didn't execute)
- [ ] ‚ùå Stop hooks execute at conversation end (NOT TESTED - systemic failure)
- [ ] ‚úÖ No error messages in proxy logs (PASSED - no execution errors, only warnings)
- [ ] ‚ùå Hook marker files created as expected (FAILED - no markers created)

**Failure Indicators**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED
- [x] ‚úÖ Missing frontmatter warnings (CONFIRMED - multiple warnings in logs)
- [x] ‚úÖ Hooks not executing when expected (CONFIRMED - no marker files created)
- [x] ‚úÖ Error messages in hook execution (CONFIRMED - syntax errors on direct execution)
- [ ] ‚ùå Proxy crashes or connection failures (NOT OBSERVED - proxy remained stable)
- [x] ‚úÖ Missing marker files (CONFIRMED - no markers created)

### Conclusion

The hooks real-world testing revealed a fundamental architectural mismatch between the test hook implementation and the execution environment. While the hook loading and configuration systems work correctly, the actual hook execution fails due to incompatible file formats between the two hook systems.

**Critical Impact**: Current hook system is effectively non-functional for the tested scenarios, preventing real-world usage of hook-based features.

**Immediate Action Required**: Fix hook file formats or update execution mechanism to support YAML frontmatter in settings-based hooks.

### Technical Debt

- Hook system has two incompatible architectures running in parallel
- Documentation doesn't clearly distinguish between hook types
- Test hooks were implemented for one system but configured for another
- No integration tests exist to catch this type of system-level failure

**Priority**: HIGH - Hook system is a core feature that is currently broken in production usage.
