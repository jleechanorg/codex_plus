## Priority 10 (Critical)
- [ ] *No critical items identified for this iteration*

## Priority 9 (High)
- [ ] Restore agent metadata compliance (add `description` frontmatter to all `.claude/agents/CLAUDE.md` definitions)
  - **Blocker:** Agent parser rejects CLAUDE agent definitions
  - **Impact:** Prevents agent registry from loading cleanly
  - **Dependency:** None
- [ ] Automate `.claude/agents` schema validation at startup
  - **Dependency:** `Restore agent metadata compliance`
  - **Impact:** Fails fast when required frontmatter fields are missing
  - **Scope:** Validation hook plus test coverage
- [ ] Fix agent directory scanning test failure (1 test failing)
  - **Dependency:** `Restore agent metadata compliance`
  - **Blocker:** Prevents CI/CD pipeline from passing
  - **Location:** `tests/test_agent_loader.py`
  - **Impact:** 201/206 tests passing (97.6%)
- [ ] Harden management API authentication & RBAC
  - **Dependency:** Fully passing test suite
  - **Scope:** Enforce role-based access control and token validation on `/api/agents/*`
  - **Impact:** Required for security validation and production approval

## Priority 8 (High)
- [ ] Implement production load testing benchmarks
  - **Dependency:** All tests must pass first
  - **Metrics needed:** Concurrent agent limits, p95 response times < 2s, throughput ≥ 100 requests/min, memory usage
  - **Target:** Handle 100+ concurrent requests with a minimum of 10 agents executing simultaneously
- [ ] Add performance monitoring dashboard
  - **Dependency:** `Implement production load testing benchmarks`
  - **Components:** Agent execution times, queue depths, error rates
  - **Integration:** Prometheus/Grafana or equivalent
- [ ] Validate configuration hot-reload workflow
  - **Dependency:** `Automate .claude/agents schema validation`
  - **Scope:** Automated schema validation and runtime reload smoke test
  - **Impact:** Guarantees configuration exit criteria remain satisfied post-deploy
- [ ] Expand audit logging coverage for agent operations
  - **Dependency:** Monitoring dashboard foundations
  - **Scope:** Log aggregation, trace IDs, and security event coverage for delegation path
  - **Impact:** Supports audit trail requirement and incident response readiness
- [ ] Execute Genesis acceptance validation checklist
  - **Dependency:** Completion of Priority 9 items, `Implement production load testing benchmarks`, and `Add performance monitoring dashboard`
  - **Scope:** Manually verify acceptance steps 1-8 (deployment, concurrency, security, aggregation, API CRUD/invoke, failure recovery, monitoring, documentation)
  - **Impact:** Confirms readiness against Genesis exit criteria before evidence capture
- [ ] Compile validation evidence pack for exit criteria sign-off
  - **Dependency:** Completion of Priority 9 items plus `Implement production load testing benchmarks` and `Execute Genesis acceptance validation checklist`
  - **Scope:** Capture load test artifacts, security test results, monitoring screenshots, and documentation links
  - **Impact:** Provides stakeholders with proof that all Genesis acceptance gates are met

## Priority 7 (Medium)
- [ ] Document production deployment procedures
  - **Include:** Environment setup, scaling guidelines, monitoring setup
  - **Format:** Step-by-step runbook (`DEPLOYMENT.md`)
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
  - **Items:** Agent timeouts, concurrent limits, cache settings
  - **Security:** Secrets management for API keys
  - **Validation:** Environment-specific configurations

## Priority 6 (Medium)
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker improvements
  - **Current:** Basic timeout handling (30s)
  - **Needed:** Adaptive thresholds, backoff strategies per agent
- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff
  - **Scope:** Failed agent executions
  - **Limits:** Max 3 retries with jitter
  - **Logging:** Track retry patterns

## Priority 5 (Low)
- [ ] Create agent capability discovery endpoint
  - **Endpoint:** `GET /agents/capabilities`
  - **Response:** Aggregated capabilities across all agents
  - **Use case:** Dynamic UI/CLI integration
- [ ] Implement agent health checks
  - **Per-agent:** Individual health status
  - **Endpoint:** `GET /agents/{id}/health`
  - **Monitoring:** Proactive failure detection

## Priority 4 (Low)
- [ ] Add agent execution history tracking
  - **Storage:** SQLite or Redis
  - **Retention:** 30 days rolling window
  - **Metrics:** Success rates, common failures
- [ ] Build agent recommendation system
  - **Logic:** Task pattern matching
  - **Learning:** Track successful delegations
  - **API:** `GET /agents/recommend?task=...`

## Priority 3 (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Create agent testing framework
  - **Mock agents:** For integration testing
  - **Test harness:** Automated capability validation
  - **Coverage:** Edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Develop agent marketplace integration
  - **Discovery:** External agent repositories
  - **Installation:** Dynamic agent loading
  - **Security:** Sandboxed execution
