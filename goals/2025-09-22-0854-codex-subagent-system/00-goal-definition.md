# Codex Plus Subagent System - Goal Definition

## Original Goal
Add sophisticated subagent functionality to codex_plus HTTP proxy that enables specialized AI assistants to work collaboratively on complex tasks. The subagent system should integrate with the existing FastAPI middleware architecture, support parallel execution, use configuration-based agent definitions, and maintain security through the proxy pipeline. Include subagent orchestration, delegation logic, result aggregation, and a management interface.

## Refined Goal
Implement a comprehensive subagent orchestration system within the codex_plus HTTP proxy that extends the existing FastAPI middleware architecture, following Claude Code CLI implementation specifications and official Anthropic documentation patterns. The system should support declarative agent configuration via YAML/JSON files, enable parallel execution of specialized AI assistants through asyncio task management, implement secure delegation logic that routes requests through the proxy pipeline, provide result aggregation mechanisms that combine subagent outputs, and include a RESTful management interface for agent lifecycle operations (create, list, update, delete, invoke).

## Reference Materials
- **Primary Source**: Official Anthropic Claude Code Subagents Documentation (https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents)
- **Subagent Architecture**: Follow Claude Code's YAML frontmatter configuration with separate context windows
- **File Structure**: Implement `.claude/agents/` directory pattern for agent definitions
- **Agent Orchestration**: Auto-delegation based on task matching, explicit invocation methods
- **Configuration Format**: YAML frontmatter with name, description, tools, model specification
- **Best Practices**: Single-purpose agents, detailed system prompts, limited tool access, version control
