## Updated GENESIS.md Content

Created comprehensive self-improvement log documenting:

### Key Learnings
- **Search validation patterns** that proved system completeness
- **Successful implementation discovery** through code inspection
- **Context conservation** via parallel tool calls

### Anti-Patterns Identified  
- False assumptions about placeholders
- Wasteful broad searches
- Redundant validation cycles

### Optimizations Discovered
- Task tool protocol for subagent delegation
- Definitive validation over exploratory checks
- Middleware integration preserving core proxy

### Critical Discoveries
- System uses native Task tool, not custom REST
- 33/33 tests confirm 100% implementation
- 5 default agents fully operational

The GENESIS.md file now serves as a learning repository for future iterations, emphasizing:
1. **Verify don't assume** - check execution not just code
2. **Batch operations** - parallel tools conserve context  
3. **Trust comprehensive tests** - full suites provide truth
4. **Document once** - single source over sprawl
5. **Focus on working code** - implementation over speculation
