# Subagent Integration Goal Definition

## Original Goal
Add subagent functionality to the codex_plus repository that can orchestrate specialized AI agents for different tasks while maintaining security and performance.

## Refined Goal Analysis
The goal is to implement a subagent system within the existing codex_plus proxy architecture that allows for:
1. Specialized AI agents focused on specific domains (code review, testing, documentation, etc.)
2. Secure delegation with tool restrictions and scope limiting
3. Parallel execution capabilities using FastAPI's async framework
4. Configuration-driven agent management similar to Anthropic's .claude.exs approach
5. Integration with existing slash command discovery and middleware systems

This system should leverage the existing proxy infrastructure while adding modular AI expertise capabilities. The implementation should follow security-first principles with declarative configuration management.

## Technical Context
- Repository: /Users/jleechan/projects_other/codex_plus
- Framework: FastAPI with existing slash command system
- Existing middleware for LLM execution and command processing
- Command discovery through .codexplus/commands/ directory structure
