# Progress Tracking - Codex CLI Task Tool Implementation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Architecture âœ…
**Target**: Foundation components for Task tool execution
- [x] TaskExecutionEngine design specification
- [x] SubagentInstance isolation model
- [x] AgentConfigLoader integration pattern
- [x] API compatibility requirements analysis
- [x] Performance benchmarking targets

### Phase 2: Task Tool API Implementation ðŸ”„
**Target**: Direct Task() function compatibility with Claude Code
- [ ] Task(subagent_type, prompt, description) function signature
- [ ] Parameter validation and error handling
- [ ] Agent type resolution and validation
- [ ] Timeout and concurrency management
- [ ] Response formatting and return values

### Phase 3: TaskExecutionEngine Core ðŸ”„
**Target**: Central coordination system for all agent execution
- [ ] AsyncSemaphore-based task queue (max 10 concurrent)
- [ ] Agent lifecycle management (spawn, monitor, cleanup)
- [ ] Metrics collection and performance monitoring
- [ ] Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Context isolation between agent instances

### Phase 4: SubagentInstance Implementation ðŸ”„
**Target**: Isolated execution environments for individual agents
- [ ] Independent context window per agent
- [ ] Tool access control and restrictions
- [ ] Resource limits and timeout enforcement
- [ ] State cleanup after execution completion
- [ ] Inter-agent communication prevention

### Phase 5: AgentConfigLoader Integration ðŸ”„
**Target**: Dynamic loading of .claude/agents/*.md configurations
- [ ] YAML frontmatter parsing for agent metadata
- [ ] Configuration validation and error reporting
- [ ] 5-minute TTL cache implementation
- [ ] Hot reload capability for config changes
- [ ] Backward compatibility with existing configs

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation ðŸ”„
**Target**: Comprehensive testing across all components
- [ ] Unit tests for TaskExecutionEngine
- [ ] Integration tests with real agent configs
- [ ] Performance benchmarking against targets
- [ ] Error scenario validation
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing

## Daily Progress Log

### 2025-09-23
**Focus**: Goal definition and architecture alignment
- âœ… Identified architectural confusion (FastAPI vs Task tool)
- âœ… Corrected goal definition from REST API to CLI function
- âœ… Copied authoritative design documents to goals directory
- âœ… Created success criteria based on TaskExecutionEngine pattern
- ðŸ”„ Setting up implementation foundation

### Upcoming Milestones

#### Week 1: Foundation (Sep 23-29)

- Set up agent configuration loading
- Create initial test framework

#### Week 2: Core Implementation (Sep 30 - Oct 6)
- Full TaskExecutionEngine with concurrency
- SubagentInstance isolation system
- Configuration caching and validation
- Performance optimization

#### Week 3: Integration & Testing (Oct 7-13)
- End-to-end integration testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Error handling validation
- Documentation completion

## Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers
