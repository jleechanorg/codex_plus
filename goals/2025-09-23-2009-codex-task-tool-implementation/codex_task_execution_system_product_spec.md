## Executive Summary

The Codex Task Execution System implements internal Task tool functionality for codex CLI, providing identical subagent coordination capabilities to Claude Code CLI. This enables multi-agent workflows with specialized AI assistants, parallel execution, and isolated context windows - all through a familiar `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` interface.

**User Value Proposition**: Developers using codex CLI gain access to powerful multi-agent coordination patterns identical to Claude Code, enabling complex workflows like `/consensus` commands, parallel code review, and specialized task delegation without requiring external dependencies or configuration changes.

**Success Metrics**: 100% API compatibility with Claude Code Task tool, sub-200ms task coordination overhead, support for 10+ concurrent subagents.

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **API Compatibility**: 100% identical interface to Claude Code Task tool for seamless workflow migration
- **Performance Parity**: Sub-200ms task coordination overhead with parallel execution up to 10 concurrent agents
- **Configuration Compatibility**: Zero-configuration migration using existing `.claude/agents/*.md` files
- **Reliability**: 99.9% task completion rate with comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Secondary Goals
- **Developer Experience**: Clear debugging and error attribution across multi-agent workflows
- **Resource Efficiency**: Intelligent memory management and context window optimization
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for custom agent types and AI service integrations
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability for task execution performance and agent health

## User Stories

### Core Functionality
- **As a developer**, I want to use `Task(subagent_type="code-review", prompt="Review this code")` in codex CLI so that I can leverage specialized AI agents for focused tasks
- **As a team lead**, I want `/consensus` commands to work identically in codex as in Claude Code so that team workflows remain consistent across tools
- **As a solo developer**, I want parallel subagent execution so that I can run code review, testing, and documentation tasks simultaneously without waiting

### Configuration Management
- **As a developer**, I want to define custom agents in `.claude/agents/my-agent.md` files so that I can create specialized workflows for my project needs
- **As a team member**, I want agent configurations to be version-controlled and shared so that team workflows are consistent and repeatable
- **As an advanced user**, I want to specify model assignments (haiku/sonnet/opus) per agent so that I can optimize cost and performance for different task types

### Error Handling & Debugging
- **As a developer**, I want clear error messages when agent tasks fail so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues
- **As a troubleshooter**, I want detailed logging of agent execution so that I can debug complex multi-agent workflows
- **As a user**, I want graceful degradation when some agents fail so that partial results are still useful

### Performance & Scalability
- **As a power user**, I want concurrent agent execution without blocking the main CLI so that I can continue working while background tasks complete
- **As a cost-conscious developer**, I want intelligent model assignment so that simple tasks use cheaper models automatically
- **As a resource manager**, I want configurable concurrency limits so that I can control system resource usage
