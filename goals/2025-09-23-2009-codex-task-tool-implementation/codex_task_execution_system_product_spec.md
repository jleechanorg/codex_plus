## User Stories

### Core Functionality
- **As a developer**, I want to invoke specialized subagents in codex_plus using natural language (e.g., "Use code-reviewer subagent to analyze this function") so that I can leverage focused AI assistance
- **As a team lead**, I want subagent workflows to be consistent and configurable so that team processes are standardized
- **As a solo developer**, I want context-isolated subagent execution so that specialized agents can focus on specific tasks without contaminating the main conversation

### Configuration Management
- **As a developer**, I want to define custom agents in `.claude/agents/my-agent.md` files so that I can create specialized workflows for my project needs
- **As a team member**, I want agent configurations to be version-controlled and shared so that team workflows are consistent and repeatable
- **As an advanced user**, I want to specify model assignments (haiku/sonnet/opus) per agent so that I can optimize cost and performance for different task types

### Error Handling & Debugging
- **As a developer**, I want clear error messages when agent tasks fail so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues
- **As a troubleshooter**, I want detailed logging of agent execution so that I can debug complex multi-agent workflows
- **As a user**, I want graceful degradation when some agents fail so that partial results are still useful

### Performance & Scalability
- **As a power user**, I want efficient context switching between agents without blocking the main CLI session
- **As a cost-conscious developer**, I want all agents to use the same LLM session to avoid additional API costs
- **As a resource manager**, I want configurable context isolation to optimize memory usage

- **Context Isolation**: Separate conversation contexts per agent to prevent cross-contamination
- **Tool Access Control**: Configurable tool restrictions per agent based on agent configuration
- **Response Integration**: Seamless integration of subagent responses into main conversation

#### Parallel Execution Framework
- **Concurrent Task Management**: Up to 10 simultaneous agent tasks with semaphore-based resource control

## User Journey Maps

### New User Flow - First Task Execution
1. **Discovery**: User sees `/consensus` command documentation
2. **Configuration**: User creates `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md` file
3. **First Execution**: User runs `Task(subagent_type="code-reviewer", prompt="Review this function")`
4. **Success Validation**: User receives structured code review results
5. **Workflow Integration**: User incorporates Task calls into existing scripts

### Returning User Flow - Multi-Agent Workflows
1. **Task Planning**: User designs multi-step workflow with multiple agents
2. **Parallel Execution**: User initiates concurrent tasks via `asyncio.gather()`
3. **Progress Monitoring**: User tracks execution progress through status updates
4. **Result Analysis**: User reviews aggregated results from all agents
5. **Iteration**: User refines agent configurations based on results

### Edge Cases
- **Agent Configuration Error**: Clear validation errors with fix suggestions
- **Context Switch Failure**: Graceful fallback to main session with error reporting
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Graceful queue management with context window optimization
- **Tool Restriction Violations**: Clear error messages when agents attempt forbidden operations
