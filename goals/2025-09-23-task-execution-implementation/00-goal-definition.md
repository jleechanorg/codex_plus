# Task Execution System Implementation Goal

## Goal Definition

Implement a complete internal Task execution system for codex CLI that provides 100% API compatibility with Claude Code's Task tool. The system will enable multi-agent coordination, parallel execution, and specialized agent workflows through a native `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` interface.

## Success Criteria

### Core Functionality (Must Have)
- [ ] **Task Function Implementation**: Internal `Task()` function with identical signature to Claude Code
- [ ] **Agent Configuration Loading**: Dynamic loading from `.claude/agents/*.md` files with YAML frontmatter
- [ ] **Parallel Execution**: Support for up to 10 concurrent agents with semaphore-based resource control
- [ ] **Context Isolation**: Separate context windows per agent to prevent cross-contamination
- [ ] **Tool Access Control**: Configurable tool restrictions per agent with inheritance from main session
- [ ] **Multi-Provider Integration**: Claude, OpenAI, Gemini APIs with automatic fallback mechanisms

### Performance Targets (Must Meet)
- [ ] **Task Coordination Overhead**: < 200ms for task setup and dispatch
- [ ] **Parallel Execution Efficiency**: 90%+ CPU utilization during concurrent agent execution
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: < 100MB overhead per active agent context
- [ ] **Reliability**: 99.9% task completion rate with comprehensive error handling

### Integration Requirements (Must Work)
- [ ] **Codex CLI Integration**: Seamless integration with existing codex command system
- [ ] **Proxy Compatibility**: Full functionality through codex_plus proxy on port 10000
- [ ] **Configuration Compatibility**: Works with existing Claude Code agent configurations
- [ ] **Command Compatibility**: `/consensus` and multi-agent commands work identically

### Testing & Validation (Must Pass)
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: 95%+ code coverage for all Task engine components
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with real API calls through proxy
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Load testing with concurrent execution up to system limits
- [ ] **Compatibility Tests**: Verify identical behavior to Claude Code Task tool

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Iterations 1-8)
**Goal**: Basic Task execution with single agent support
- TaskExecutionEngine with async semaphore control
- AgentConfigLoader with YAML frontmatter parsing
- SubagentInstance with isolated context management
- Basic ModelAPIClient with Claude API integration
- Unit test framework with mocked dependencies

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Coordination (Iterations 9-16)
**Goal**: Parallel execution and advanced error handling
- ParallelTaskExecutor with batching and error isolation
- Tool access control system with inheritance and restrictions
- Multi-provider API integration (OpenAI, Gemini) with fallback
- Circuit breaker pattern for API reliability
- Integration tests with real API calls

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (Iterations 17-24)
**Goal**: Production-ready reliability and observability
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Metrics collection and performance monitoring
- Configuration validation with helpful error messages
- End-to-end testing with realistic workloads

### Phase 4: Validation & Optimization (Iterations 25-30)
**Goal**: Performance optimization and final validation
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Compatibility testing against Claude Code behaviors
- Documentation and troubleshooting guides
- Final integration testing through codex_plus proxy
- User acceptance testing with real workflows

## Technical Constraints

### Environment Requirements
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/jleechan/projects_other/codex_plus`
- **Proxy Integration**: Must work through codex_plus proxy on port 10000
- **Execution Method**: Use `codex exec --yolo` for rapid iteration
- **Python Version**: Python 3.9+ with async/await support
- **Dependencies**: Pure asyncio, httpx, pydantic for core functionality

### Architecture Constraints
- **Internal Implementation**: Built into codex CLI, not external MCP server
- **Async-First**: Pure asyncio patterns with proper exception handling
- **File-Based Config**: Uses `.claude/agents/*.md` files identical to Claude Code
- **Tool Inheritance**: Configurable tool access with security restrictions
- **Provider Abstraction**: Unified interface for multiple AI service providers

## Definition of Done

### Functional Completeness
- All core functionality implemented and tested
- 100% API compatibility with Claude Code Task tool
- Full integration with codex CLI and proxy system
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Quality Standards

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Dependencies**: Multiple external APIs with different failure modes → Circuit breaker pattern with automatic fallback

### Implementation Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Feature complexity growth → Strict adherence to MVP requirements with defer list
- **Integration Challenges**: Codex CLI integration complexity → Incremental integration with fallback modes
- **Performance Issues**: Resource usage under load → Continuous performance monitoring and optimization

## Success Metrics

### Development Metrics

- **Performance Satisfaction**: Response times comparable to or better than Claude Code
- **Reliability**: 99.9% successful task execution rate
- **Usability**: Zero configuration changes required for basic usage
