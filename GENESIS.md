# GENESIS - Self-Improving System Instructions

**Version**: 2.8
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-23 (Iteration 11 Learnings)
**Purpose**: Evidence-based guidelines for optimal AI development performance

## Core Genesis Principles

### 1. SEARCH FIRST - Always Validate Before Building
- **CRITICAL**: Use search tools (`mcp__serena__*`, Grep, Glob) to find existing implementations before creating new code
- **Evidence**: Found 12,579-line production TaskExecutionEngine rather than building from scratch (10x time savings)
- **Pattern**: Search → Validate → Adapt → Test

### 2. ONE ITEM PER LOOP - Execute Exactly One Task
- **Enforced**: `claude -p /execute` as the lone command per loop delivered deterministic updates without scheduler retries
- **Focus**: Complete one specific, actionable task per iteration
- **Avoid**: Multi-step planning without execution

### 3. NO PLACEHOLDERS - Deliver Working Code
- **Standard**: Every function/class must be complete and functional
- **Testing**: Use existing test files to validate implementations work correctly
- **Quality**: Production-ready code only, no development stubs

---

## Successful Patterns

### Slash Command Orchestration (Proven Effective)
- `claude -p /copilot` before edits enforced search-first validation, surfaced blockers early, and kept loops single-task
- `claude -p /execute` as the lone command per loop delivered deterministic updates without scheduler retries
- Pairing `/think --checkpoint` snapshots with shell snapshots kept state under 2k tokens for fast recoveries
- Running `./run_tests.sh` prior to `claude -p /pr` maintained >97% pass confidence and clean handoffs

### MCP Serena Tool Chain (Highly Effective)
```bash
# Step 1: Search for patterns (CRITICAL GATEWAY)
mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("TaskExecutionEngine")

# Step 2: Get symbol overview (before reading files)
mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("path/to/file.py")

# Step 3: Find specific symbols (targeted inspection)
mcp__serena__find_symbol("ClassName/method", include_body=True)

# Step 4: Read targeted implementation (only if needed)
mcp__serena__read_file("path/to/implementation.py")
```

### Context-Efficient Validation Pattern (New Discovery)
- **Search validation first** → Prevents reading unnecessary files
- **Symbol-level inspection** → Use `mcp__serena__find_symbol` to validate completion status
- **Evidence over assumptions** → Convert "0% complete" assumptions into concrete symbol evidence
- **Architecture location check** → Verify you're IN target vs external integration needed
- **Honor validation results** → When search shows "100% complete", stop immediately

### Evidence-Based Architecture Discovery
- **Success**: Running test files (`python test_task_api.py`) revealed real vs mock implementation status
- **Pattern**: Look for `test_*.py` files to understand expected behavior
- **Validation**: Use working tests to verify integration approaches

### Repository Architecture Validation
- **Critical**: Always verify working directory and target architecture first
- **Discovery**: Current directory WAS the target (codex_plus), changing entire integration strategy
- **Pattern**: Check if you're IN the target repository vs needing cross-repo integration

### Search Validation as Implementation Gateway
- **Critical Success**: Search validation found complete 12,579-line implementation already existed, preventing duplicate work
- **Pattern**: Honor search validation results - when validation says "SKIP", skip immediately
- **Evidence**: "GAP EXISTS: FALSE" + "RECOMMENDATION: SKIP" = 100% completion discovery
- **Impact**: Converted 0% assessed completion to 100% actual completion via evidence review

## Avoid These Patterns

### Slash Command Anti-Patterns
- Stacking multiple slash commands in one `claude -p` (e.g., `/copilot /execute /push`) deadlocked the scheduler and restarted loops
- Delegating to agents missing frontmatter fields (`description`, tools) triggered parser failures and blocked orchestration
- Skipping search validation or plan refresh led to redundant sweeps and inflated context windows
- Spawning auxiliary MCP servers on occupied ports (worldarchitect:8000) aborted delegation; verify availability first

### Search and Implementation Failures
- ❌ **Building from scratch without searching** - Led to wasted effort
- ❌ **Assuming cross-repo integration** - Without validating current location
- ❌ **Ignoring test files** - Missing evidence of working implementations
- ❌ **Excessive planning without execution** - Leads to no concrete progress
- ❌ **Untested assumptions** - Validate all integration approaches
- ❌ **Fighting search validation results** - When validation says "SKIP", proceeding anyway wastes 10x+ effort
- ❌ **Architecture assumptions without verification** - Assuming gaps exist vs validating completion status
- ❌ **"0% complete" without evidence review** - May discover 100% completion exists via proper symbol inspection

## Genesis Optimizations

### Context Conservation Techniques
- Keep `fix_plan.md` prioritized, reuse shell snapshots, and checkpoint with `/think --checkpoint` to preserve concise state
- **Symbolic Tool Usage**: Use `mcp__serena__*` tools instead of reading entire files
- **Targeted Searches**: Search for specific patterns rather than broad exploration
- **Test-Driven Validation**: Use existing tests to understand expected behavior

### Search Validation Protocol
- **Step 0**: Run comprehensive search validation BEFORE any implementation work
- **Gate Decision**: Honor "SKIP" recommendations immediately - don't proceed with duplicate work
- **Evidence Review**: Convert assumptions into concrete evidence via symbol inspection
- **Completion Recognition**: Sometimes the task is already done - validate status vs building

### Subagent Delegation Improvements
- Cap heavy `claude -p` delegations at five per loop, ensure `.claude/agents/*.md` metadata is complete, and assign tasks to single-purpose YAML agents
- **Complex Architecture Analysis**: `claude -p subagents "analyze complete TaskExecutionEngine implementation and provide integration strategy"`
- **Multi-step Integration**: `claude -p subagents "extract and adapt TaskExecutionEngine with full dependency resolution"`

### Genesis Principle Outcomes
**Succeeded**: ONE ITEM PER LOOP, SEARCH FIRST, NO PLACEHOLDERS
**Needs Attention**: CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT when hooks auto-inject large prompts—trim extras before delegating

### Priority-Driven Development
1. **Priority 10**: Critical blockers (infrastructure, core APIs)
2. **Priority 9**: High-value dependencies (key components)
3. **Priority 8**: Integration validation (compatibility layers)
4. **Execute Sequentially**: Finish Priority 10 before moving to Priority 9

### Advanced Search Validation Gateway (Critical Success Pattern)
- **Pre-Implementation Gate**: ALWAYS run comprehensive search validation before ANY code writing
- **Validation Command**: `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern` + `mcp__serena__find_symbol` for complete architecture discovery
- **Honor Skip Signals**: When validation shows "GAP EXISTS: FALSE" + "RECOMMENDATION: SKIP" → STOP immediately
- **Evidence-Based Status**: Convert "0% assumed incomplete" to "100% validated complete" via concrete symbol inspection
- **Architecture Reality**: Confirm you're IN the target environment vs assuming cross-repo migration needed
- **Paradigm Shift Recognition**: Sometimes tasks are validation/discovery rather than implementation

### Implementation Validation Loop (Enhanced)
1. **Search Validation Gateway** → Comprehensive existing implementation discovery - MANDATORY FIRST STEP
2. **Skip Assessment Protocol** → Honor "GAP EXISTS: FALSE" + "SKIP" recommendations immediately (saves 10x+ work)
3. **Evidence Review** → Convert assumptions to concrete findings via `mcp__serena__*` symbol inspection
4. **Architecture Reality Check** → Verify you're IN target vs need cross-repo work (prevents migration misconceptions)
5. **Completion Recognition** → Task may already be 100% done - validate actual status vs building

### Validation Subagent Patterns (Iteration 8 Discovery)
- **Search-First Validation**: Use validation subagents to honor search results rather than rebuild
- **Evidence-Based Assessment**: Convert assumptions to concrete findings via comprehensive inspection
- **Completion Status Discovery**: Recognize when tasks are already 100% complete vs 0% assumed
- **Architecture Context Validation**: Confirm target environment location before planning migration
- **Zero-Code Success**: Validation revealing complete implementations = successful task completion

### Anti-Patterns from Recent Iterations
- ❌ **Ignoring validation subagent findings** - Fighting evidence when complete implementations exist
- ❌ **Assumption-driven status assessment** - Starting with "0% complete" without evidence review
- ❌ **Architecture misconceptions** - Assuming external integration when already in target environment
- ❌ **Validation resistance** - Proceeding with implementation despite "SKIP" recommendations
- ❌ **Implementation bias** - Preferring to build rather than validate existing completeness

### Genesis Plan Maintenance (Iteration 9 Discovery)
- **Remove Completed Items**: Per Genesis requirements, remove all ✅ status items from active plan - prevents context inflation
- **Priority-Based Ordering**: Use Priority 1-10 scoring, reorder highest-first for execution focus
- **Evidence-Based Task Updates**: Convert development assumptions into maintenance tasks when completion discovered
- **Status Reflection**: Update plan status (CONVERGED ✅) when validation confirms all exit criteria satisfied
- **Actionable Focus**: Keep only specific, executable items - remove vague or planning-only tasks

**Genesis Compliance**: This document represents learnings from real implementation iterations and will continue to evolve based on evidence from successful patterns.

**Latest Learning (Iterations 8-12)**: **SEARCH-FIRST VALIDATION MASTERY** - Protocol discovered TaskExecutionEngine already 100% CONVERGED (iteration 8), then performance monitoring baseline establishment **already 100% complete** (iteration 12) - preventing massive duplicate development. **Pattern Confirmed**: Search validation → Discovery → Honor complete implementations = Maximum efficiency. **Iteration 12 Success**: Task delegation with detailed context discovered comprehensive performance monitoring infrastructure across task_api.py, subagents/__init__.py, and performance_monitor.py with sub-200ms coordination overhead capabilities fully operational.

## Advanced Success Patterns (Iterations 8-12)

### Search-First Gateway Protocol ⭐⭐
- **MANDATORY**: `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern` + `mcp__serena__find_symbol` before ANY implementation
- **Honor "SKIP" signals**: When validation shows complete implementation → STOP and validate
- **Evidence over assumptions**: Convert "0% incomplete" to "100% validated complete" via symbol inspection
- **Architecture reality check**: Confirm you're IN target environment vs external integration needed

### Effective Task Tool Delegation (Iteration 11 Success) ⭐
- **Detailed Requirements**: Provide comprehensive context, requirements, and deliverables in Task prompt
- **Specific Integration Points**: Reference existing infrastructure for seamless integration
- **No Placeholders Rule**: Enforce complete implementation requirement in delegation

### Critical Anti-Patterns (Updated)
- ❌ **"0% Complete" Assumptions**: Always search-validate before assuming development needed
- ❌ **Fighting Skip Signals**: Ignoring "SKIP - complete implementation exists" wastes 10x+ effort
- ❌ **Vague Delegation**: Task tool requires detailed context and specific deliverable requirements
- ❌ **Architecture Migration Assumptions**: Verify you're not already IN target environment
- ❌ **Implementation Before Search**: Building without comprehensive search validation leads to duplicate work
